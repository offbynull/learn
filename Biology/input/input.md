# Introduction

Biology is defined as the study of life / living things. A living thing is defined as anything that converts energy from one form to another, while using that energy to grow, change, and reproduce.

# Scientific Method

The `{bm} scientific method` is the standard guideline for discovery and experimentation in the sciences (chemistry, physics, biology, etc..) The basic steps are...

1. Observe.
2. Ask a question about the observation.
3. Make a guess that answers the question (hypothesis).
4. Test the guess to see if it's correct (experiment).
5. Refine and iterate.

The last step (refine and iterate) just means that you do it all over again but make changes based on the things you learned from your experiment. For example, ...

* do additional experiments to dig into some aspect deeper.
* if the hypothesis wasn't supported by the experiment, maybe come up with a new hypothesis.

## Hypothesis

The scientific method revolves around making an observation and coming up with a testable explanation for that observation -- called a `{bm} hypothesis`. If the explanation isn't *testable*, you can't consider it a hypothesis. For example, a good hypothesis may be that increased sun exposure leads to an increased risk of skin cancer because it's something you can test. A bad explanation may be that exposure to centaurs increase the risk of skin cancer because centaurs don't exist (and as such the hypothesis can't be tested).

```{note}
The material mentions that for a hypothesis to be testable, you should be able to come up with an experiment that shows that its false -- it's falsifiable. How you word your hypothesis is typically what determines if it's testable/falsifiable -- when you read the hypothesis, what defines a failure?
```

```{note}
A hypothesis and a theory are different things. Hypothesis is a potential answer for a specific problem. A theory provides a potential framework for a much broader class of problems based on supporting evidence. The example given by the material: "The toaster won't toast because the electrical outlet is broken" is a hypothesis, whereas "Electrical appliances need a source of electricity in order to run" is closer to a theory.
```
## Experiment

Once you have a hypothesis, you design an `{bm} experiment` to test it. In the case of our sun exposure leads to increased risk of skin cancer hypothesis, an experiment may be to expose skin cells to UV rays in amounts equivalent to that given off by the sun and then check to see if those cells have been damaged (compared to a control group of skin cells that you haven't exposed to UV rays).

What makes a good experiment?

* `{bm} Control group` - A control group contains a set of entities that don't get treatment, but those entities are equal to the entities in the `{bm} experimental group` (as much as possible) and exposed to the same conditions as the entities in the experimental group (as much as possible). This helps eliminate outside factors/variables from tainting the results of an experiment -- it's a `{bm} controlled experiment` . For example, in the skin cancer example experiment described above, a control group may be a set of skin cells that sit along side the experimental group skin cells that get treated with UV rays -- the cells in the control group shouldn't show signs of damage while the cells in the experimental group should.
* `{bm} Random selection` - The entities being used for an experiment must be randomly selected (both for the control group and the experimental group). Random selection helps minimize skewed results introduced from bias during the selection process. For example, the individual responsible for selecting candidates for drug trials may choose to disproportionately select people of a certain race (e.g. racism).
* `{bm} Double blind` - The people conducting the experiment may implicitly/explicitly taint the experiment via their own bias. For example, if the experiment involves an interviewer asking a set of questions, the interviewer may subconsciously change the pronunciations of words if he/she knows that the interviewee is in the control group, there by effecting the answer given by the interviewee.
* **Statistical significance** - The results between the control group and the experimental group needs to be large enough to support your hypothesis. A small difference could mean that outcome was due to variance in the selected groups (there's a branch of statistics that deals with this).
* **Replicable** - Others should be able to repeat the same experiment and (hopefully) come to the same result. If they don't, it could be that something was wrong with your experiment or the entities being tested had some underlying difference that changed the result.

```{note}
There's always at least one control group in any experiment to provide a baseline. There's no limit to the number of experimental groups -- each group may have a slightly different type/amount of treatment applied.
```

```{note}
Because things are so wishy-washy/not-exacty in biology, it's typical for an experiments to be repeated multiple times and to have a large sample size -- the larger our sample sizes and the more times we conduct the experiment, the more we can be confident of our result. What do I mean by wishy-washy? Genetic variation between samples may result in different types/levels of responses. For example, people with a certain gene may respond quicker to certain drugs than people who don't produce that gene.
```

Other terminology around the scientific method...

* `{bm} treatment` - The application of the test given to the experimental group(s) but not the control group.
* `{bm} independent variable` - An independent variable is basically the treatment you apply -- you can think of it as the input knob you control for your experiment. For example, in the skin cancer experiment, the independent variable would be the amount of artificial UV rays you apply to the skin cells.
* `{bm} dependent variable` - A dependent variable is a response you measure after applying the treatment -- you can think of it as the output from your experiment. For example, in the skin cancer experiment, the dependent variable might be a measurement of how different the cells are functioning (e.g. a cell with damaged DNA may produce different kinds / amounts of tRNA molecules -- something you can measure).
* **data** - This is exactly what you think it is -- measurements/observations made during the experiment.
* `{bm}|no_out placebo` `{bm} placebo effect` - When experimenting on people, there's a phenomenon called the placebo effect: if someone takes something that shouldn't help them but are under the impression it will help them, it often times will help them, just from the psychological effect alone.

```{note}
You can have more than one independent variable if you follow specific guidelines and are experienced enough, but the general rule of thumb is to have only 1 independent variable just because it makes things much simpler to analyze/interpret.

# Chemistry

An **element** is matter that cannot be broken down any further by chemical reaction -- it's a substance made entirely out of one type of `{bm} atom`. Each element/atom has a specific set of properties that defines how it acts/reacts (e.g. weight, colour, how light reflects, etc..).

Examples of elements/atoms:
* Gold - Yellow coloured, reflective, malleable, and corrosion-resistant.
* Lead - Blue/white coloured, relatively soft, malleable.
* Carbon Silver/gray coloured, reflective, easily oxidizes/corrodes.

Examples of non-elements:
* Salt water - Mixture of sodium and water.
* Water - Water can be further broken down to the elements hydrogen and oxygen.
* Glucose - Glucose can be further broken down to the elements carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.

The building blocks of atoms are `{bm} protons`, `{bm} neutrons`, and `{bm} electrons`. Protons and neutrons form the nucleus of the atom while electrons jump around outside of the nucleus. Protons and electrons are attracted to each other -- protons are positively charged while electrons are negatively charged. Although, protons and electrons never fully meet (electrons are always buzzing/hovering around the outside of the nucleus where the protons are).

The configuration of an atom (protons/neutrons/electrons) is what allows us to predicate how one element may react to another element. For example, certain elements may attract, repel, bond, swipe electrons, etc..

The number of protons are what defines the type of atom/element. For example, hydrogen has 1 proton, helium as 2, lithium has 3, etc.. The number of neutrons and electrons can change without changing the type of element as long as the number of protons remain the same.

The periodic table below orders elements/atoms by the number of protons (also called the `{bm} atomic number`)...

```{note}
A different number of neutrons = different version of the same element. For example, Carbon-12 (6 neutrons) and Carbon-13 (7 neutrons).
