# Introduction

Biology is defined as the study of life / living things. A `{bm} living/\b(living|life)\b/i` thing is defined as anything that converts energy from one form to another, while using that energy to grow, change, and reproduce.

# Scientific Method

The `{bm} scientific method` is the standard guideline for discovery and experimentation in the sciences (chemistry, physics, biology, etc..) The `{bm-ri} basic` steps are...

1. Observe.
2. Ask a question about the observation.
3. Make a guess that answers the question (hypothesis).
4. Test the guess to see if it's correct (experiment).
5. Refine and iterate.

The last step (refine and iterate) just means that you do it all over again but make changes based on the things you learned from your experiment. For example, ...

* do additional experiments to dig into some aspect deeper.
* if the hypothesis wasn't supported by the experiment, maybe come up with a new hypothesis.

## Hypothesis

The scientific method revolves around making an observation and coming up with a testable explanation for that observation -- called a `{bm} hypothesis`. If the explanation isn't *testable*, you can't consider it a hypothesis. For example, a good hypothesis may be that increased sun exposure leads to an increased risk of skin cancer because it's something you can test. A bad explanation may be that exposure to centaurs increase the risk of skin cancer because centaurs don't exist (and as such the hypothesis can't be tested).

```{note}
The material mentions that for a hypothesis to be testable, you should be able to come up with an experiment that shows that its false -- it's falsifiable. How you word your hypothesis is typically what determines if it's testable/falsifiable -- when you read the hypothesis, what defines a failure?
```

```{note}
A hypothesis and a theory are different things. Hypothesis is a potential answer for a specific problem. A theory provides a potential framework for a much broader class of problems based on supporting evidence. The example given by the material: "The toaster won't toast because the electrical outlet is broken" is a hypothesis, whereas "Electrical appliances need a source of electricity in order to run" is closer to a theory.
```

## Experiment

Once you have a hypothesis, you design an `{bm} experiment` to test it. In the case of our sun exposure leads to increased risk of skin cancer hypothesis, an experiment may be to expose skin cells to UV rays in amounts equivalent to that given off by the sun and then check to see if those cells have been damaged (compared to a control group of skin cells that you haven't exposed to UV rays).

What makes a good experiment?

* `{bm} Control group` - A control group contains a set of entities that don't get treatment, but those entities are equal to the entities in the `{bm} experimental group` (as much as possible) and exposed to the same conditions as the entities in the experimental group (as much as possible). This helps eliminate outside factors/variables from tainting the results of an experiment -- it's a `{bm} controlled experiment` . For example, in the skin cancer example experiment described above, a control group may be a set of skin cells that sit along side the experimental group skin cells that get treated with UV rays -- the cells in the control group shouldn't show signs of damage while the cells in the experimental group should.
* `{bm} Random selection` - The entities being used for an experiment must be randomly selected (both for the control group and the experimental group). Random selection helps minimize skewed results introduced from bias during the selection process. For example, the individual responsible for selecting candidates for drug trials may choose to disproportionately select people of a certain race (e.g. racism).
* `{bm} Double blind` - The people conducting the experiment may implicitly/explicitly taint the experiment via their own bias. For example, if the experiment involves an interviewer asking a set of questions, the interviewer may subconsciously change the pronunciations of words if he/she knows that the interviewee is in the control group, there by effecting the answer given by the interviewee.
* **Statistical significance** - The results between the control group and the experimental group needs to be large enough to support your hypothesis. A small difference could mean that outcome was due to variance in the selected groups (there's a branch of statistics that deals with this).
* **Replicable** - Others should be able to repeat the same experiment and (hopefully) come to the same result. If they don't, it could be that something was wrong with your experiment or the entities being tested had some underlying difference that changed the result.

```{note}
There's always at least one control group in any experiment to provide a baseline. There's no limit to the number of experimental groups -- each group may have a slightly different type/amount of treatment applied.
```

```{note}
Because things are so wishy-washy/not-exactly in biology, it's typical for an experiments to be repeated multiple times and to have a large sample size -- the larger our sample sizes and the more times we conduct the experiment, the more we can be confident of our result. What do I mean by wishy-washy? Genetic variation between samples may result in different types/levels of responses. For example, people with a certain gene may respond quicker to certain drugs than people who don't produce that gene.
```

Other terminology around the scientific method...

* `{bm} treatment` - The application of the test given to the experimental group(s) but not the control group.
* `{bm} independent variable` - An independent variable is `{bm-ri} basically` the treatment you apply -- you can think of it as the input knob you control for your experiment. For example, in the skin cancer experiment, the independent variable would be the amount of artificial UV rays you apply to the skin cells.
* `{bm} dependent variable` - A dependent variable is a response you measure after applying the treatment -- you can think of it as the output from your experiment. For example, in the skin cancer experiment, the dependent variable might be a measurement of how different the cells are functioning (e.g. a cell with damaged DNA may produce different kinds / amounts of tRNA molecules -- something you can measure).
* **data** - This is exactly what you think it is -- measurements/observations made during the experiment.
* `{bm} placebo effect/(placebo effect|placebo)/i` - When experimenting on people, there's a phenomenon called the placebo effect: if someone takes something that shouldn't help them but are under the impression it will help them, it often times will help them, just from the psychological effect alone.

```{note}
You can have more than one independent variable if you follow specific guidelines and are experienced enough, but the general rule of thumb is to have only 1 independent variable just because it makes things much simpler to analyze/interpret.
```

# Chemistry

An **element** is matter that cannot be broken down any further by chemical reaction -- it's a substance made entirely out of one type of `{bm} atom`. Each element/atom has a specific set of properties that defines how it acts/reacts (e.g. weight, colour, how light reflects, etc..).

Examples of elements/atoms:
* Gold - Yellow coloured, reflective, malleable, and corrosion-resistant.
* Lead - Blue/white coloured, relatively soft, malleable.
* Carbon Silver/gray coloured, reflective, easily oxidizes/corrodes.

Examples of non-elements:
* Salt water - Mixture of sodium and water.
* Water - Water can be further broken down to the elements hydrogen and oxygen.
* Glucose - Glucose can be further broken down to the elements carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.

The building blocks of atoms are `{bm} protons`, `{bm} neutrons`, and `{bm} electrons`. Protons and neutrons form the nucleus of the atom while electrons jump around outside of the nucleus. Protons and electrons are attracted to each other -- protons are positively charged while electrons are negatively charged. Although, protons and electrons never fully meet (electrons are always buzzing/hovering around the outside of the nucleus where the protons are).

The configuration of an atom (protons/neutrons/electrons) is what allows us to predicate how one element may react to another element. For example, certain elements may attract, repel, bond, swipe electrons, etc..

The number of protons are what defines the type of atom/element. For example, hydrogen has 1 proton, helium as 2, lithium has 3, etc.. The number of neutrons and electrons can change without changing the type of element as long as the number of protons remain the same.

The periodic table below orders elements/atoms by the number of protons (also called the `{bm} atomic number`)...

![By Offnfopt - Own work, Public Domain, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=62296883](800px-Simple_Periodic_Table_Chart-en.svg.png)

```{note}
A different number of neutrons = different version of the same element. For example, Carbon-12 (6 neutrons) and Carbon-13 (7 neutrons).
```

When atoms bind together, they form a `{bm} molecule`. Each type of molecule has the same configuration of atoms -- same atoms in the same numbers, structured/shaped similarly. For example, a water molecule is made up of 2 hydrogen atoms and 1 oxygen atom binding together in a house-roof shape...

![By Dan Craggs - Own workThis vector image includes elements that have been taken or adapted from this:  Water-2D-labelled.png., Public Domain, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=7916072](200px-H2O_2D_labelled.svg.png)

```{note}
As far as I can tell, the atoms will always bind in the same way. You can't ever have a molecule that has the same types of atoms in the same numbers but with a different structure.
```

A `{bm} monomer` is a special designation for atoms/molecules that are able to join with other monomers to create even larger molecules. The process of joining is called `{bm} polymerization/(polymerization|polymerize)/i` and the resulting molecule is called a `{bm} polymer`.

```{dot}
digraph {
  rankdir=LR;
  "monomer"->"polymer" [taillabel="1..*", headlabel="1", arrowhead=none];
}
```

If the monomers that make up a polymer are all the same, the polymer is called a `{bm} homopolymer`. Otherwise, it's called a `{bm} heteropolymer` / `{bm} copolymer`.

For example, the glucose molecule is a monomer. It can combine with other glucose molecules to create the glycogen molecule, which is a polymer / homopolymer. Other examples of polymers (according to Wikipedia): amino acids and nucleotides (DNA).

```{note}
There are probably special properties to monomers that allow them to chain up. The Wikipedia page talks about a feature of monomers being a "carbon double bond" which is what allows them to form polymers.
```

Polymers are often referred to as `{bm} macromolecule`s -- molecules that have a very large number of atoms.

An `{bm} ion/\b(ions|ion)\b/i` is a charged atom or molecule. A charged atom/molecule just means that it has an unequal number of protons and electrons:
* if protons > electrons (more protons), it's called a `{bm} positively charged/(positive charge|positive-charge|positively-charged|positively charged)/i` ion / `{bm} positive ion`.
* if protons < electrons (more electrons), it's called a `{bm} negatively charged/(negative charge|negative-charge|negatively-charged|negatively charged)/i` ion / `{bm} negative ion` / `{bm} ANION`.
* if protons == electrons, it's a neutral (no charge).

Ions are always trying to lose their charge and become neutral, either by giving up an electrons or pulling in an electrons such that the the number of protons and electrons become equal. As such, ions will attract towards oppositely charged ions and repel from similarly charged ions:
* negative ions are attracted to positive ions and repelled from negative ions.
* positive ions are attracted to negative ions and repelled from positive ions.

## pH

`{bm} pH/\b(pH)\b/` stands for *potential of hydrogen* and it's the measure of positively charged hydrogen ions in a solution. The more...
* the more `{bm} acidic/(acidity|acidic|acid)/i` something is, the more positively charged hydrogen ions it has.
* the more `{bm} basic/(basicity|basic)/i` `{bm} /(bases|base)_pH/i` (`{bm} alkaline`) something is, the more reactive it is to positively charged hydrogen ions (it wants to give off electrons to those hydrogen ions).

![By Heinrich-Boll-Stiftung - https://www.flickr.com/photos/boellstiftung/35805740223, CC BY-SA 2.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=66098876](800px-PH_Scale-_Acidic_vs._Basic_(Alkaline).png)

pH is scaled logarithmically from 1 to 14. Each notch on the scale moves the acidity/basicity by a factory of 10. Going...
* back a notch (-1) increases acidity / decreases basicity by a factor of 10.
* forward a notch (+1) decreases acidity / increases basicity by a factory of 10.

For example, going from  7 to 4 increases acidity by 1000x times / decreases basicity by 1000x.

The closer to...
* 1 something is, the more acidic it is (more positively charged hydrogen ions) and the more sour/sharp it tastes.
* 14 something is, the more basic it is (more stuff that can react with positively charged hydrogen ions) and the more bitter it tastes.
* 7 something is, the more neutral it is (not reactive).

```{note}
https://www.quora.com/Why-is-pure-water-considered-neutral -- Since pH is defined as the negative log of the hydrogen ion concentration, the pH of pure water is 7 or neutral. Pure water is neutral because the number of positive hydrogen ions produced is equal to the number of negative.
```

## Carbohydrate Molecules

`{bm} Carbohydrate/(carbohydrate|sugar)/i`s (also called `{bm} saccharide`s) are molecules that consist of a mix of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms. In biological systems, carbohydrates are often associated with...
* being a source of energy
* providing a structural role (for plants / certain plants).

```{note}
It was never explained what 'structural role' actually means.
```

The term `{bm} monosaccharide` is just means a carbohydrate that's a monomer (e.g. glucose). Similarly, the term `{bm} polysaccharide` means a carbohydrate built from other monosaccharides (e.g. glycogen is made of chained glucose).

```{dot}
digraph {
  rankdir=LR;
  "monosaccharide"->"polysaccharide" [taillabel="1..*", headlabel="1", arrowhead=none];
}
```

## Protein Molecules

`{bm} Protein`s are molecules that consist of monomers called `{bm} amino acid`s. The amino acids get chained together into a polymer called a `{bm} polypeptide` chain, and one or more polypeptide chains fold to a 3D structure and combine to become a protein. The 3D structure / shape of the protein (how its folded) is what gives it its abilities.

In biological systems, proteins are often associated with that facilitating some biological function. For example, the protein protease is responsible for breaking down food.

```{dot}
digraph {
  rankdir=LR;
  "amino acid"->"polypeptide" [taillabel="1..*", headlabel="1", arrowhead=none];
  "polypeptide"->"protein" [taillabel="1..*", headlabel="1", arrowhead=none];
}
```

## Lipid Molecules

`{bm} Lipid`s are molecules that are somewhat not water soluble -- meaning that they have parts that resist water but maybe also parts that are attracted to water. In biological systems, lipids are often associated with...
* energy storage (fats)
* cellular membranes (phospholipids)

![Public Domain, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=1019610](296px-Trimyristin-3D-vdW.png)

```{note}
Lipids are not always fats. All fats are lipids but not all lipids are fats.
```

## Water Molecule

`{bm} Water` is essential to life -- it has unique properties that almost all biological processes depend on.

Recall that...
1. a water molecule consists of 2 hydrogen atoms connected to an oxygen atom via covalent bonds. A `{bm} covalent bond` is a pair of electrons that both atoms share, thus bonding the atoms together.
1. the position of an electron is based on probability. Electrons aren't fixed in a certain position or neatly orbiting around a nucleus as certain diagrams show. Rather, they're constantly buzzing/hopping around the nucleus. Depending on their environment, they may be more likely to be at certain locations vs other locations.

Oxygen atoms are extremely `{bm} electronegative`, meaning that oxygen has the propensity to pull the buzzing/hopping electrons more around itself than the atoms it's bound to. As such, in a water molecule, the electrons will spend more time solely around the oxygen atom than they do the hydrogen atom or a position that binds the hydrogen and oxygen together. This is what gives the oxygen atom in a water molecule a `{bm} weakly negative` charge (as indicated by δ-) while the hydrogen atoms have a `{bm} weakly positive` charge (as indicated by δ+). These types of charged molecules are called `{bm} polar molecule`s.

![By OpenStax College - Anatomy & Physiology, Connexions Web site. http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6/, Jun 19, 2013., CC BY 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=30131144](209_Polar_Covalent_Bonds_in_a_Water_Molecule.jpg)

```{note}
Notice the shape of the water molecule in the diagram(s) above. Electron pairs are repelled from each other. They're also responsible for binding. That's what gives molecules their shapes/structure.
```

This weakly negative / weakly positive charge is what gives water several of the unique properties that biological properties depend on. Water molecules have a tendency to gravitate towards each other because the weakly negative oxygen atoms and the weakly positive hydrogen atoms of different water molecules attract. This attraction is called a `{bm} hydrogen bond`. Hydrogen bonds are weaker than covalent bonds in that the bonds aren't really solid -- water molecules can easily break off and go past each other.

```{note}
The above paragraph is just giving the mechanics for how/why water is a liquid. Water is the only molecule that's liquid at room temperature? This can't be right -- see https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/q/76346. Why can't biological processes work in one of these other molecules just as they do in water? Maybe because they stay liquid at a shorter temperature range (e.g. 15-25C instead of 1-99C?
```

The weak attraction between water molecules is also what makes water a `{bm} solvent`. So long as they're polar molecules, other molecules can travel inside of water using the same attraction from weakly negative / weakly positive charges -- they gravitate and float around water molecules just as other water molecules do. For example, the cytoplasm of a cell is a solvent (mostly water). It works because other molecules in the cytoplasm (e.g. cellular machinery) can float around / travel around using the weakly negative / weakly positive charges.

Water is called a `{bm} universal solvent` because it can dissolve more molecules than other other liquid. Note that the term universal doesn't mean that it can dissolve everything, just that it can dissolve more things than the others.

The properties that make water conducive for biological processes to operate:

* Fluid under normal conditions - under normal temperatures, pressures, etc.. there's `{bm} cohesion` between other water molecules (fluid) / `{bm} adhesion` between water molecules and other polar molecules / ions (solvent).
* Universal solvent - Water dissolves more things than any other liquid (more things doesn't mean everything).
* High heat capacity - Because it takes a lot of energy to heat up water, its temperature can remain relatively stable as the environment around it changes (temperature regulation).
* High heat of vaporization - As water evaporates, it traps heat from whatever its on (e.g. human body) and releases it into the environment (temperature regulation / cooling).
* Less dense as a solid - As water freezes it forms crystals that space the molecules away from each other. As such, it becomes less dense than liquid water and ends up floats on top. This means bodies of water can freeze over but life can continue operating in the liquid underneath the frozen ice.

Other terminology related to water:
* Molecules that are charged are called polar molecules (e.g. the water molecule is a polar molecule because of its weakly positive / weakly negative charge).
* Molecules / ions that are charged and mixed with a solvent are called `{bm} solute`s.
* Molecules that are attracted to water are called `{bm} hydrophilic`.
* Molecules that are repelled from water are called `{bm} hydrophobic`.
* Molecules that have parts that are hydrophilic as well as parts that are hydrophobic are called `{bm} amphipathic`

# Cell

`{bm} Cell`s are the `{bm-ri} basic` unit of living things / the building blocks of life. They're tiny structures that encapsulate information and machinery that allows them to replicate/reproduce and perform other important functions (e.g. appendages to move around).

```{note}
Viruses are not cells but they may also be considered living because they reproduce in a roundabout way: the require machinery in the host cell to reproduce.
```

There are 2 types of cells: eukaryotic and prokaryotic. There main differences between them are that...

1. the guts of eukaryotes are organized into organelles (membrane-bound compartments) where each one is responsible for some functionality, while prokaryotes have no organelles at all (guts are free floating).
1. the DNA in eukaryotes into multiple independent segments (chromosomes), while prokaryotes have a single circular chain.

Other differences between eukaryotes and prokaryotes ...

```{csv}
!!{ "firstLineHeader": true }
, Eukaryotes, Prokaryotes
Size, 10 to 100 micrometers (μm), 0.1 to 5 micrometers (μm)
Complexity, More complex, More simple
Sub-compartments (organelles), Yes, No
DNA layout, Multiple stands, Single circular strand
Single-cell organisms, Yes (e.g. amoeba), Yes (e.g. bacteria and archaea)
Multi-cell organisms, Yes (e.g. animals and fungus), No
```

```{note}
Archaea is an organism that looks like bacteria but they're totally different.
```

## Features

Different cell species vary in features. The subsections below detail common cell features (not exhaustive).

Some features are only present in certain cell speicies (e.g. only some cells have a flagellum tail) while other features are present in all cells but in different amounts (e.g. every cell has cytosol but larger cells have more cytosol).

### Cytoplasm

The `{bm} cytoplasm` (both eukaryotic and prokaryotic) is the insides/guts of a cell. `{bm} Cytosol` refers to just the fluid, while cytoplasm refers to fluid as well as everything else inside the cell.

Every cell has cytoplasm.

### Membrane

The `{bm} plasma membrane/(Plasma membrane|Membrane)/i` (present in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells) is the thing encapsulating the cytoplasm. It's what keeps the guys of the cell inside and controls the movement of substances coming into / going out of the cytoplasm.

Every cell has a membrane encapsulating its cytoplasm. Membranes in general follow the fluid mosaic model.

The term membrane can refer to either the plasma membrane or the membrane of a eukaryotic cell's organelle. How you should interpret it depends on the context in which its used.

Facts about cell membranes:

 * Membranes have other molecules embedded in them for identification, moving stuff in/out, etc.. (see fluid mosaic model).
 * Membranes are semipermeable. Uncharged substances such as carbon dioxide and oxygen move across fine, while charged ions or large molecules require either
   * membrane proteins such as a carrier protein or a channel protein (see fluid mosaic model).
   * membrane wrapper (see golgi).

### Cell Wall

The `{bm} cell wall` (present in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells) is a stiff layer around the membrane meant for protection. *Not all cells have a cell wall* -- for example, animal cells don't but plant cells do. Technically, the cell wall (if it exists) isn't considered to be part of the cell. The membrane and everything in it is.

The material states that cell walls...
1. provide an extra layer of protection.
1. help maintain shape.
1. help prevent dehydration.

Almost all prokaryotes have cell walls. Only some eukaryotes have cell walls (e.g. fungi and plants). The material says that cell walls for most bacteria are made up of a molecule called `{bm} peptidoglycan`, but it can be different for other cells. For example, [this link](https://www.quora.com/Do-Eukaryotes-have-cell-walls) says that plant cells have cell walls made up of cellulose.

### Capsule

The `{bm} Capsule` (present in prokaryotic cell only) is the outermost layer of some types of cells (typically bacteria cells). Capsules are made up of carbohydrates and there mainly to help the cell stick itself to the environment.

Although eukaryotic cells don't have capsules, they do have carbohydrates on their outside. Those carbohydrates aren't organized as a capsule though: https://www.quora.com/Do-some-eukaryotic-cells-have-capsules-or-is-it-just-prokaryotes-Are-there-exceptions-of-eukaryotes-having-capsules. Is this talking about the same carbohydrates that are embedded in the membrane (glycolipids / glycoproteins).
```

### Ribosome

`{bm} Ribosome` (present in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells) are tiny molecular machines inside the cytoplasm that take in mRNA molecules (portions of DNA that have been written out) and produce proteins. Ribosomes themselves are structures made of proteins and RNA.

Ribosomes can either be floating around in the cytoplasm (called `{bm} free ribosome`) or be embedded in the membrane of endoplasmic reticulum.

### Appendage

Some cells have appendages that help them move (or stay put). There are different types of appendages...
  * `{bm} Flagellum` are tails that extend from the cell (e.g. tail on a sperm cell). There can be more than 1 flagellum.
  * `{bm} Cilia/\b(Cil|Cils|Cilia)\b/i` are much smaller hair-like appendages used to help move the cell itself or things in the vicinity of the cell.
  * `{bm} Fimbriae` are much smaller hair-like appendages used to help attach to host cells and surfaces (e.g. bacteria cells).
  * `{bm} Pili` are much smaller hair-like appendages used to help transfer DNA between cells and/or to help move (e.g. bacteria cells).
  * `{bm} Pseudopodia/\b(Pseudopod|Pseudopodia)\b/i` are much larger leg-like appendages used to crawl (e.g. amoeba cells).

## Fluid Mosaic Model

The `{bm} fluid mosaic model` is the accepted model for how cell membranes work. The model says that a cell membrane is composed of a phospholipid bilayer with proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates floating around on either side or embedded in between.

```{note}
The description above is the rational for the name 'fluid mosaic model'. It's fluid and there's a mosaic of different things embedded or attached to it.
```

A `{bm} phospholipid` is a amphipathic lipid molecule that involves a phosphate group. The...
* bulbus phosphate group at the top is hydrophilic -- it has a charge and as such is attracted to water (either the cytoplasm or the fluid outside the cell).
* long fatty acid tails are hydrophobic -- they have no obvious charge and as such aren't attracted to water.

```{note}
For a refresher on how hydrophobic / hydrophilic molecules work, see the section on Water. Specifically: adhesion / weakly negative / weakly positive.
```

![By OpenStax - https://cnx.org/contents/FPtK1zmh@8.25:fEI3C8Ot@10/Preface, CC BY 4.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=30131167](0301_Phospholipid_Structure.jpg)

As such, phospholipids have a natural tendency to form as a `{bm} phospholipid bilayer` (2 layers attached together, called a `{bm} liposome`) or a ball (called a `{bm} micelle`). The hydrophilic heads are going to point towards the water causing the hydrophobic tails to point at each other.

![By Mariana Ruiz Villarreal ,LadyofHats - Own work, Public Domain, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=3032610](Phospholipids_aqueous_solution_structures.svg.png)

```{note}
If the phospholipids have small tails, they may form a micelle (a small, single-layered sphere), while if they have bulkier tails, they may form a liposome.
```

How fluid a phospholipid bilayer is depends on the types of phospholipid molecules that make it up and the temperature. Phospholipid molecules have 2 fatty acid tails. The fatty acid tails can be either...

* both saturated (straight tails)
* one saturated (straight tail) and one unsaturated (bent tail).

At cooler temperatures, phospholipids that have 2 saturated fatty acid tails (straight tails) tend to get more rigid / dense because they can more easily pack together. Phospholipids with unsaturated fatty acid tails (bent tails) don't end up getting as rigid / dense, allowing the membrane to stay fluid at lower temperatures. Cholesterol embedded in the phospholipid bilayer also helps it stay more fluid at lower temperatures.

```{note}
Phospholipid bilayers have the consistency of oil-based salad dressing. It may seem weak but it's strong enough to act as a separator between the environment inside and the environment outside. Water from one-side can move to the other but does so very rarely -- a single molecule may sneak through the layer every now and then. Aquaporins are proteins embedded in the phospholipid bilayer that allow water to rapidly pass (when needed).
```

Examples of molecules that can be embedded in or attached to the phospholipid bilayer include...

* `{bm} Glycolipid`s / `{bm} Glycoprotein`s - These are lipids and proteins with carbohydrates attached to them and are typically found pointing outside of the cell. These carbohydrates are how a cell identifies if a neighbouring cell is foreign or not.
* `{bm} Integral protein/(integral protein|integral enzyme)/i`s - Proteins that are partially hydrophobic. Either one end of the protein is anchored inside the membrane or the protein is fully going through the membrane.
  * `{bm} Transmembrane protein/(transmembrane protein|transmembrane enzyme)/i`s - Proteins that have one end inside the cytoplasm and the other outside of the cell. Typical use case for these types of proteins is moving substances from inside the cell (cytoplasm) to outside the cell and vice-versa: `{bm} channel protein`s and `{bm} carrier protein`s.
* `{bm} Peripheral protein/(peripheral protein|peripheral enzyme)/i`s - Proteins that are found on the surface of the protein (either on the cytoplasm side or the outside side). Unlike integral proteins, they don't have any portion going inside the membrane. As such, they more freely move around compared to integral proteins.
* `{bm} Cholesterol` - Sits inside of the membrane to help ensure that the membrane doesn't become too stiff.

```{note}
See first diagram in this section for an example of each of the molecules listed above.
```

The term `{bm} facilitated diffusion` refers to the movement of molecules across the membrane via proteins embedded in the membrane (e.g. channel proteins and/or carrier proteins). These molecules wouldn't be able to cross the membrane by themselves. For example, the sodium potassium pump (carrier protein) helps sodium and potassium ions move across the cell membrane by opening/closing its gates.

## History of Modern Cell Theory

The first record of a cell was in 1665 when `{bm} Robert Hooke` published a book called The Micrographia. The book contains drawings of observations he made while looking at various dead organisms through a rudimentary microscope.

A few years later, a Dutch lenscrafter by the name of `{bm} Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek/\b(Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek|Anthony Van Leeuwenhoek)\b/i` decided to use his expertise to craft a better microscope to better observe living cells / organisms. For example, he was able to observe sperm and Protists (unicellular organisms while he dubbed `{bm} animalcule`s).

In the 1830s, `{bm} Matthias Schleiden` and `{bm} Theodore Schwann` began laying the groundwork for modern cell theory. They came up with the idea that...
1. all life is composed of one or more cells.
2. a cell is the `{bm-ri} basic` unit of life.

They also suspected that cells come from other cells, but didn't know for sure if that was the only way they were produced. It was `{bm} Robert Remak` that in the mid-1800s established that...

3. all cells come from other cells.

`{bm} /\b(Rudolph Virchoi|Rudolph Virchow)\b/i`

```{note}
The credit for this sometimes goes to Rudolph Virchoi but it's been established that he was a plagiarist.
```

It's still an open question as to how the first / initial cell came to be. The current working theory is that, 3.5 billion years ago, phospholipids (the molecules that form the membrane of a cell) naturally form bilayers and connect in a circle. A membrane may have naturally encapsulated a set of arbitrary self-replicating molecules (e.g. protein or RNA) and that's how the first cell began growing and splitting off.

```{note}
There are an estimated 37 trillion cells in the human body.
```

`{bm} Eukaryotic/(Eukaryote|Eukaryotic)/i` cells are typically larger and have membrane-bound sub-compartments, called organelle, that hold in the guts of different regions of the cell. For example, their DNA is encapsulated in a organelle called the nucleus.

Eukaryotes have their DNA broken up into multiple strands called chromosomes. They can either be single-cellular organisms (e.g. amoeba) or multi-cellular organisms (e.g. human). Single-cellular organism that are eukaryotic are called `{bm} protist`s.

The following are descriptions for some of the organelles shown in the diagram above.

## Organelle

Eukaryotic cells have membrane-bound sub-compartments, called `{bm} organelle`s, that house different functional regions of the cell. The following subsections detail common organelles.

### Nucleus

`{bm} Nucleus/\b(Nucleus|Nuclei)\b/i` is an organelle that contains DNA (genetic information required for the functioning and replication). Both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells have DNA, but only eukaryotic cells have a nucleus. In prokaryotic cells, the DNA flows around freely instead of being encapsulated in a nucleus.

```{img}

scale 0.75 0.75
```

Most eukaryotic cells contain a single nucleus, but some contain can have 0 and others can have more than one. An example of 0 is blood cells -- mature blood cells don't have any DNA, therefore no nucleus. An example of more than 1 is the organism Oxytricha trifillax -- it contains 2 nuclei, each containing different DNA (its DNA is fragmented across 2 nuclei).

### Endoplasmic Reticulum

`{bm} Endoplasmic Reticulum` is layered membrane (organelle?) that surrounds the nucleus and is directly connected to pores on the nucleus. Large portions of the endoplasmic reticulum's membrane have ribosomes attached. The parts that have ribosomes attached are called `{bm} rough endoplasmic reticulum` while the parts that don't are called `{bm} smooth endoplasmic reticulum`.

```{note}
It's called rough endoplasmic reticulum because the ribosomes make the surface look rough.
```

```{img}
0313_Endoplasmic_Reticulum.jpg
a) The ER is a winding network of thin membranous sacs found in close association with the cell nucleus. The smooth and rough endoplasmic reticula are very different in appearance and function (source: mouse tissue). (b) Rough ER is studded with numerous ribosomes, which are sites of protein synthesis (source: mouse tissue). EM × 110,000. (c) Smooth ER synthesizes phospholipids, steroid hormones, regulates the concentration of cellular Ca++, metabolizes some carbohydrates, and breaks down certain toxins (source: mouse tissue). EM × 110,510. (Micrographs provided by the Regents of University of Michigan Medical School © 2012)

```

Recall that ribosomes are what translate mRNA to proteins. Since the endoplasmic reticulum is directly connected to the nucleus (via pores on the nucleus), it provides a fairly straight-forward path for protein generation: mRNA produced in the nucleus...
1. travels to the endoplasmic reticulum via the connected pores,
2. then travels to the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum where it ends up hitting ribosomes embedded in the (thereby producing proteins).

### Golgi

`{bm} Golgi/(Golgi Apparatus|Golgi Complex|Golgi Body|Golgi)/i`</span> are layered membrane (organelle?) that look similar to rough endoplasmic reticulum but aren't attached to the nucleus. Golgi package molecules (e.g. proteins) for travel to either another part of the cell or outside of the cell. They do this by pinching off parts of their membrane to wrap around the molecule.

They're also responsible for building lysosomes (cell digestion machines).

```{note}
The terms golgi, golgi apparatus, golgi complex, and golgi body all refer to the same thing.
```

### Mitochondria
`{bm} Mitochondria/(Mitochondria|Mitochondrion)/i`</span> are organelles responsible for cellular respiration: the process of producing Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) from molecules such as sugars. ATP is a chemical that provides energy to drive various biological processes (e.g. muscle contractions). As such, mitochondria are often referred to as "the power house of the cell."

```{note}
Mitochondria exist in both animal and plant cells. 
```

The major parts of chloroplast are...

 * <span style="color:#ff00ffff">`{bm} mitochondrial envelope`</span> - 2 membrane layers that have a gap between them. Holds the guts in.
 * <span style="color:#008080ff">`{bm} matrix`</span> - Internal fluid of mitochondria. Contains the guts (ribosomes, mitochondrial DNA, and more).
 * <span style="color:#808000ff">`{bm} cristae`</span> - Long caverns that encapsulate and connect different parts of the matrix.

Mitochondria have their own independent DNA (different from the DNA in the nucleus). It's speculated that at some point in the past they may have been independent single-cell organisms that formed a symbiotic relationship with a larger cell by `{bm-ri} living` in it, eventually becoming part of the cell (endosymbiosis).

Unlike how normal offspring DNA gets produced by mixing DNA from both parents, mitochondrial DNA comes entirely from the mother's side.


### Lysosome

`{bm} Lysosome`s are organelles (animal cells only) that help break down waste `{bm-ri} products` / foreign substances by containing various enzymes and maintaining an acidic pH. Lysosomes are more often found in animals cells than plant and algae cells.

```{note}
According to the material, the evidence that they've been found in plant cells is recent.
```

### Peroxisome

`{bm} Peroxisome`s are organelles that are similar to Lysosomes -- both are small organelles that break down unwanted substances. The difference is that peroxisomes have different types of enzymes that require oxygen (oxidative enzymes).

```{note}
The material says that peroxisomes make hydrogen peroxide: Similarly, structures called peroxisomes carry out chemical reactions called oxidation reactions and produce hydrogen peroxide, both of which would damage the cell if they weren’t safely stored away in their own “room.”
```

### Chloroplast

`{bm} Chloroplast`s are organelle (only plant and algae cells) responsible for photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the process of taking in light and using it to build sugars from water and carbon dioxide. Those sugars are then used by the mitochondria to produce energy in a process called cellular respiration.

The major parts of chloroplast are...

 * <span style="color:#ff00ffff">`{bm} chloroplast envelope`</span> - 2 membrane layers that have a gap between them. Holds the guts in.
 * <span style="color:#008080ff">`{bm} stroma`</span> - Internal fluid of chloroplast (chloroplast's version of cytosol).
 * <span style="color:#808000ff">`{bm} thylakoid`</span> - Membrane-bound discs. The membrane contains light-harvesting substances while the space inside (also called `{bm} lumen`) is hollow.
 * <span style="color:#ff0000ff">`{bm} grana/(grana|granum)/i`</span> - Stack of thylakoids. These stacks are interconnected. The singular of grana is granum.

 `{bm} Chlorophyll` is a pigment / compound found in chloroplast that absorbs light and uses it to produce carbohydrates. It's found in the thylakoid membrane as well as the stroma, and it only absorbs red and blue light (while reflecting green).

 Like mitochondria, chloroplast have their own independent DNA (different from the DNA in the nucleus). It's speculated that at some point in the past they may have been independent single-cell organisms that formed a symbiotic relationship with a larger cell by `{bm-ri} living` in it, eventually becoming part of the cell (endosymbiosis). A descendant of that organism may be `{bm} cyanobacterium/(cyanobacterium|cyanobacteria)/i`, which has a similar ability to generate sugars from light (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chloroplast&oldid=918130624#Parent_group:_Cyanobacteria)).

### Vacuole

`{bm} Vacuole`s are organelle (mostly plant and algae cells) responsible for storage (water, food, waste?) and enzymes that help break things down. Vacuoles are typically found in plant and algae cells, but may also exist in animal cells. The ones in plants / algae tend to be much larger.

Vacuoles are often responsible for a plant's shape. For example, a well watered plant will be upright and spry because its vacuoles are full. A plant that isn't as well watered may be sagging down or wilting because the vacuoles are less full

In biology, turgor pressure or turgidity is the pressure of the cell contents against the cell wall, in plant cells, determined by the water content of the vacuole, resulting from osmotic pressure.

## Chromosome

The genome of eukaryotes are split into linear strands of DNA. These linear DNA strands come in 2 forms...

1. `{bm} Chromatin` is the normal state, where the DNA is loosely floating around with structural proteins called `{bm} histone`s.
1. `{bm} Chromatid` is the state where it's going through replication. The DNA is packed using even more structural proteins called  `{bm} scaffold protein`s and the entire thing has a copy of itself attached. The original and the copy are individually referred to as `{bm} sister chromatid`s. Together they're referred to as a `{bm} sister chromatid pair`.

Chromatin and chromatid are mutually exclusive. As long as it has a copy attached to it, it's referred to as chromatid. Otherwise, it's referred to as chromatin.

The term `{bm} chromosome` can refer either to a chromatin or a sister chromatid pair, but never a single sister chromatid.

scale 0.5 0.5
```

At a high-level, the process of DNA replication can be boiled down to 3 steps...

1. The chromatin is copied. Each instance is now referred to as a chromatid and is attached to the other (sister chromatid) via proteins called `{bm} cohesin`s.
2. The sister chromatids condense and start to separate in an X shape. The section they remain connected at is a segment of DNA called the `{bm} centromere`.
3. The sister chromatids are pulled apart. Each instance is now reverted back to being referred to as chromatin.

A cell can have a number of chromosome copies:
 * `{bm} diploid` cells carry 2n chromosomes (2 copies of each chromosome). 1 copy comes from the mother and the other comes from the father, and the copies aren't identical -- they code for different versions of the same genes. Each of the 2 copies are said to be a homologous pair. Examples include animal somatic cells and animal germ cells.
 * `{bm} haploid` cells carry n chromosomes (1 copy of each chromosome). Examples include animal gamete cells and most unicellular eukaryotes.
 * `{bm} polyploid` cells carry An chromosomes, where A > 2 (more than 2 copies of each chromosome). Examples include certain plant species (e.g. lotus plants) and some forms of human muscle tissue.

```{note}
An example straight from the material of diploid chromosomes working: As a real example, let's consider a gene on chromosome 9 that determines blood type (A, B, AB, or O). It's possible for a person to have two identical copies of this gene, one on each homologous chromosome—for example, you may have a double dose of the gene version for type A. On the other hand, you may have two different gene versions on your two homologous chromosomes, such as one for type A and one for type B (giving AB blood).
```

The following diagram shows a karyotype of a human's diploid chromosome pairs 1 2 and 3:

Certain eukaryotic species (some mammals/snakes/insects/etc..) have an extra pair of chromosomes that aren't alternate versions of each other but instead are totally different and used to determine the sex of the offspring. This extra pair is called `{bm} sex chromosome/(sex chromosome)/i`s / `{bm} XY chromosome/(XY chromosome|X\/Y chromosome|X-Y chromosome)/i`s, and it determines the sex of the organism. The X and the Y refer to the chromosome types that can appear in the pair -- XX results in a female, while XY results in a male.

The non-sex chromosome pairs are referred to as `{bm} autosome`s.

## Mitosis (Cell Cycle)

The `{bm} cell cycle` is the sequence of events a cell goes through from when it's created (divides off) up to when it divides itself. In eukaryotic cells, the cell cycle has 2 major phases:

 1. Interphase: The majority of a cell's life is spent in interphase, where it's growing and going about its business.
 1. Mitotic phase: The portion of a cell's life where it divides into 2 new cells. 

Each phase has a set of inner phases it goes through.

   The cell grows.
   
   Prior to entering the next phase, the cell can go into the `{bm} G0 phase` / `{bm} resting phase`,  where it's essentially pausing division. One reason for this may be `{bm} contact inhibition`: when cells start touching up on other cells, it's a signal that it's becoming too crowded and that they should stop dividing. 

1. `{bm} S phase` / `{bm} Synthesis phase`

   The sister chromatid pairs start to condense into an X shape, where the only part they remain attached at is their centromeres. The membrane of the nucleus goes away and the 2 centrosomes that were originally attached to that membrane get moved to opposite ends of the cell.

   Microtubules are attached from the centrosomes to the kinetochore of the sister chromatid pairs. `{bm} Kinetochore`s are proteins located at the centromere of the sister chromatids.

   As the cell splits apart, the microtubules also split apart the sister chromatid pairs. Once split, they're individually referred to as chromatin again.

   During telophase, nucleus membranes re-form around the newly split chromatin. The chromatin also start to un-condense.

   During cytokinesis, the middle of the cell starts to push together and pinch off, forming 2 separate cells. Cytokinesis technically happens in parallel with mitosis (it isn't a part of mitosis), but it starts near the end of mitosis (around telophase).

## Meiosis

`{bm} Meiosis` is a type of eukaryotic cell division that results in 4 daughter cells, where each daughter cell has half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell.

The source cell is known as a `{bm} germ` cell -- a cell that can either go through mitosis or meiosis. `{bm} Somatic` cells, on the other hand, are general body cells and can only go through mitosis.

The resulting daughter cells are known as `{bm} gamete` cells -- cells that have half the genetic information from the original parent (haploid -- only 1 chromosome of from each of the parent's homologous chromosome pairs), and when they merge they mix that genetic material to create the new genetic material for the offspring. Male gamete cells are called `{bm} sperm`, while female gamete cells are called `{bm} ova/\b(ova)_GAMETE/i` or `{bm} egg/\b(egg)_GAMETE/i`s.

```{note}
Gamete cells no longer have the ability to divide (this is a terminal operation)
```

Meiosis has 2 major phases:
 1. Meiosis I phase: Germ cell mixes genetic information in itself and divides into 2.
 1. Meiosis II phase: Each of the 2 cells created above get divided again. But, this time the resulting daughter cells only have half the generic information (gamete cells).

### Meiosis I

During `{bm} meiosis I`, a germ cell divides in such a way that, rather than exactly duplicating each chromosome, it duplicates and mixes between each homologous chromosome pair. That is, chromosome pairs that are different versions of each other end up swapping segments (chromosomal crossover).

```{note}
Remember that most cells have a diploid number of chromosomes (2n), where each chromosome is a different version of another chromosome in that same cell (homologous pairs -- e.g. code for different versions of the same gene). One comes from the mother and one comes from the father.

    Each chromatin duplicates to become a sister chromatid pair (2 chromatids that are attached to each other). Then, each sister chromatid pair condenses and forms an X shape where the only part that the sister chromatids remain attached at is their centromeres.
    
    The membrane of the nucleus goes away and the 2 centrosomes that were originally attached to that membrane get moved to opposite ends of the cell. Microtubules are attached from the centrosomes to the kinetochore of the sister chromatid pairs.

    While in their condensed form, sister chromatid pairs go through a process called `{bm} chromosomal crossover`: A chromatid from a sister chromatid pair swaps segments of itself with a chromatid from another sister chromatid pair. The sister chromatid pairs doing the swapping must be homologs of each other (contains alternative versions of the same genes).

    ```{note}
    Remember that the source cell comes with 2n chromosomes, where each chromosome has a sibling that has alternate versions of the same genes. One sibling came from the father and the other sibling came from the mother. The homolog refers to this sibling -- each sibling contains different versions of the same set of genes.

    ```

    The end result is that the sister chromatids are no longer exact copies of each other.
   
    The point at which a segment swap happens is called the `{bm} chiasma/(chiasmata|chiasma)/i`. The chiasma is a well defined point on the chromatids (it isn't random).

    As the cell splits apart, microtubules move apart the homologous pairs of sister chromatid pairs to opposite ends of the cell. Each side gets 1 of the of sister chromatid pairs.

    The term _homologous pairs of sister chromatid pairs_ here is confusing:
     * _sister chromatid_ means 1 of 2 chromatids that are attached to each other at their centromeres.
     * _sister chromatid pair_ means 2 _sister chromatids_ that are attached to each other at their centromeres.
     * _pair of sister chromatid pairs_ means 2 _sister chromatid pairs_.
     * _homologous pair of sister chromatid pairs_ refers to a 2 _sister chromatid pairs_ that were derived from 2 homologous chromatin/chromosomes.

    ```{note}
    What does homologous chromatin mean? Remember that the source cell comes with 2n chromatin, where each chromatin has a sibling that has alternate versions of the same genes. One sibling came from the father and the other sibling came from the mother. Homologous chromatin/chromosomes refers to those 2 siblings.

    Nucleus membranes re-form around the newly moved apart sister chromatid pairs. The sister chromatid pairs also start to un-condense but still remain attached at their centromeres. As such, the resulting daughter cells are said to have a haploid number of chromosomes -- each sister chromatid pair is technically considered to be 1 chromosome until it splits apart.

    During cytokinesis, the middle of the cell starts to push together and pinch off, forming 2 separate cells. Cytokinesis technically happens in parallel with telophase I (it isn't a part of telophase I), but it starts around the same time.

### Meiosis II

During `{bm} meiosis II`, each daughter cell from meiosis I will divide again, but this time the sister chromatid pairs split and each resulting daughter cell keeps 1. In other words, each daughter cell from meiosis I will divide again to become 2 gamete cells.

The steps in meiosis II are almost exactly the same as the steps in the miotic phase -- the sister chromatid pairs are essentially being split apart into 2 new cells. Similar to how there's a rest period between mitosis iterations (called interphase), there may be a rest period between meiosis I and meiosis II called `{bm} interphase II`.

    During telophase, nucleus membranes re-form around the newly split chromatin. The chromatin also start to un-condense. The resulting daughter cells are gametes at this point (e.g. sperm cells). They no longer divide. 

    During cytokinesis, the middle of the cell starts to push together and pinch off, forming 2 separate cells. Cytokinesis technically happens in parallel with telophase II (it isn't a part of telophase II), but it starts around the same time.

## Cancer

`{bm} Cancer` refers to the uncontrolled division of cells (mitosis) in a multicellular organism, typically brought on by one or more mutations.

Normally, a cell has internal and external cues / regulators that signal when it should stop dividing (e.g. contact inhibition). When a mutation occurs that causes one or more of these cues to be ignored, the cell goes through a form a programmed suicide called apoptosis. If the genetic mutations are so severe that apoptosis no longer occurs, that's when cancer occurs.

A group of cells that have been dividing unimpeded is known as a `{bm} neoplasm` / `{bm} tumor`. If the cells...
 * eventually stop dividing on their own, that mass of cells is called a `{bm} benign neoplasm` / `{bm} benign tumor`.
 * continually divide without ever stopping, that mass of cells is called a `{bm} malignant neoplasm` / `{bm} malignant tumor`.

Mutations of two types of cell cycle regulators can promote the development of cancer:
 * Positive regulators, which normally promote cell growth, may become hyperactive (oncogenic).
 * Negative regulators (tumor suppressors), which prevent the formation of tumors, may become inactivated.

Tumor cells may continue to mutate at a more rapid pace than other cells. If one of those mutations results in tumor cells breaking off from the original mass of tumor cells and floating around the body, the cancer is said to have `{bm} metastasize`d. 

## Fertilization

`{bm} Fertilization/(fertilization|fertilize)/i` is the act of bringing together a male gamete (e.g. sperm) to a female gamete (e.g. egg_GAMETE) (cell types produced through meiosis). In humans, a fertilized egg_GAMETE is referred to as a ...

 * `{bm} zygote` upon creation. At this point the male gamete and the female gamete have fused together to become a single cell, but their nuclei will still be separate (will eventually fuse).

## Apoptosis

`{bm} Apoptosis` is a form of programmed cell death in multicellular organisms. For example, apoptosis can be triggered by the cell...

* detecting a faulty mutation within its own DNA, there by avoiding a potential problem (e.g. cancer).
* to sculpt body parts as part of normal development (e.g. cells in feet die during embryonic / fetal development to create gaps between toes).

In apoptosis, the membrane of the cell begins to shrink and pinch inward. It breaks up its DNA and organelle and encircles them into miniature components that eventually bud off from the cell and float away. Cells from the immune system will then come and ingest those buds and/or other cells can reuse the components in those buds for their own purposes without suffering any damage.

In contrast, `{bm} necrosis` is a form of cell death that isn't programmed -- the cell swells up and explodes. It isn't desirable and often occurs in extreme cases (e.g. exposed to a chemical toxin, mechanical damage, etc..). The guts of the cell, rather than being neatly encircled and budding off, will burst outwards and potentially damage other cells in the vicinity.

```

`{bm} Prokaryotic/(Prokaryote|Prokaryotic)/i` cells: These cells are typically smaller and don't have organelles. For example, their DNA is free-floating in the cell (it's free floating but stays mostly in the center area called the  `{bm} nucleoid`).

Prokaryotes have a single circular-strand of DNA. They can only be single-cellular organisms (e.g. bacteria).

# Enzyme

An `{bm} enzyme` is a molecule that takes in a specific set of input molecules and transforms them into a specific set of output molecules. The transformation takes the inputs and either ...
 * assembles them into new larger molecules (N to 1).
 * separates them into smaller molecules (1 to N).
 * transfers fragments between them (N to N).

Enzymes facilitate these transformations by lowering the `{bm} activation energy` (`{kt} E_A`) required for the chemical reactions to take place.  Normally this excess energy would come in the form of heat, but enzymes use different mechanisms such as...
* temporarily contorting input molecules
* temporarily pulling away some charge from adjacent atoms of input molecules

... such that other atoms can get close enough to bond.

```{note}
How does heat provide activation energy? More heat = more molecules moving faster = more things bumping into each other faster. 2 molecules may have atoms that want to bond but neighbouring atoms on those molecules may be repelling away with stronger force. Increased speed means the repelling is less effective. 
```

An enzyme is almost always a protein molecule but can also be a RNA-like molecule called a `{bm} ribozyme`.

The general terminology for enzymes are as follows:

 * `{bm} Substrate` / `{bm} Reactant`s refers to the input molecules of an enzyme.
 * `{bm} Product/(product)_ENZYME/i` refers to the output molecules of an enzyme.
 * `{bm} Metabolite` refers to either a substrate or product_ENZYME.
 * `{bm} Metabolism` is the total sum of all the chemical reactions that take place inside of a cell. These reactions happen via enzymes.
 * `{bm} Active site`s are the physical locations that substrates float into on an enzyme.
 * `{bm} Catalysis` / `{bm} Catalyze` is the term for increasing the rate / probability of a chemical reaction. Enzymes perform catalysis.
 * `{bm} Catalyst`s are entities that speed up chemical reactions but don't change in the process (reaction happens but catalyst remains). Enzymes are catalysts.

Enzymes have a limited set of substrate types that they accept. A substrate will bind to the active site of the enzyme only if it fits into the active site. For example, the following diagram shows 2 substrates binding to an enzyme, the enzyme facilitating their their assembly, then releasing back out.

It was previously thought that enzymes had a “lock-and-key” model, similar to how puzzle pieces fit together. Later on it was found out that an enzymes actually `{bm} induce fit/(induced fit|induce fit)/i` by changing shape slightly when they bind with substrates, such that they can better hold on to those substrates.

Examples of enzymes and what they do:

 * protease → breaks up protein molecules to smaller protein molecules.
 * sucrase → breaks up sucrose molecules to simpler sugar molecules.
 * RNA polymerase → scans over DNA... splitting it, generating mRNA, and stitching it back up.

## Metabolic Pathway

A `{bm} metabolic pathway` is a network/graph of enzymes that produces a final resulting molecule. Each enzyme produces molecules that feed into other enzymes in the pathway, eventually forming the final molecule. The term `{bm} intermediate/(intermediate)_ENZYME/` refers to an output of one enzyme that’s used as an input by another.

For example, the following graph is the metabolic pathway for gamma-hydroxybutyric acid...

## Anabolism

Metabolism can be broken down into 2 categories: anabolism (building-up) and catabolism (breaking-down).

The process that builds up a molecule from smaller molecules is called `{bm} anabolism/(anabolic|anabolism)/i`. An enzyme takes in the molecules and creates bonds between them via an `{bm} endergonic reaction`s: energy is stored as bonds between the smaller molecules thereby forming the larger molecule.

```{note}
A good way to remember the reaction types... In ENDergonic reactions, the energy ENDs up in a bond. In EXergonic reactions, the energy EXplodes out thereby breaking the bond.
```

```

An example of anabolism is photosynthesis: plants will bond carbon dioxide gas (`{kt} CO_2`) with water (`{kt} H_2O`) using energy from the sun, creating sugar (`{kt} C_6H_{12}O_6`)

`{kt} 6CO_2 + 6H_2O + energy \to C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2`

## Catabolism

Metabolism can be broken down into 2 categories: anabolism (building-up) and catabolism (breaking-down).

The process that breaks down a large molecule into smaller molecules is called `{bm} catabolism/(catabolic|catabolism)/i`. An enzyme takes in a larger molecule breaks up some of its bonds via `{bm} exergonic reaction`s: energy used as bonds in the molecule are release thereby breaking it up into smaller molecules.

```{note}
A good way to remember the reaction types... In ENDergonic reactions, the energy ENDs up in a bond. In EXergonic reactions, the energy EXplodes out thereby breaking the bond.

An example of catabolism is cellular respiration: cells will break down the bonds in glucose (`{kt} C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2`) to release energy, splitting into carbon dioxide (`{kt} CO_2`) and water (`{kt} H_2O`)

# Nucleotides

`{bm} Nucleic Acid` is a molecule (heteropolymer) that's built up from other molecules called `{bm} nucleotide`s (monomers). Nucleic acid comes in 2 flavours: DNA and RNA. Each nucleotide consists of a sugar molecule (ribose in RNA / deoxyribose in DNA) attached to a phosphate group and a nitrogen-containing base_nucleotide.

```{note}
It's called nucleic acid because it has some acidic properties to it and DNA is found in the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell. But DNA also in prokaryotic cells and some organelles -- those don't have a nucleus.

The base is what distinguishes the types of nucleotides from each other. The term nucleotide and base are often used interchangeably.
```

 Two nucleotides connected together are called a `{bm} base pair`. The rules to base pairs are:
 * A only ever binds to T/U (e.g. AT or TA in DNA, AU or UA in RNA)
 * G only ever binds to C (e.g. GC or CG)

# DNA

`{bm} Deoxyribonucleic acid` (`{bm} DNA`) is a nucleic acid molecule that contains the instructions needed for the growth/functioning/maintenance of an organism. Depending on the type of organism, DNA is located in different parts fo the cell.
 * For prokaryotes, DNA is free-floating in the cytoplasm.
 * For eukaryotes, DNA is isolated in the nucleus (`{bm} nuclear DNA`). Their mitochondria and chloroplast also have their own DNA.

```

DNA is composed of two strands of nucleotides that connect at various points in between. The order these nucleotides appear in defines the genetic information/instructions of the organism. For example, a string/sequence of DNA bases_nucleotide: ATATTTTCGATATCCACCA.

DNA strands can be made up of 4 different nucleotide types (bases_nucleotide): 
 * A (adenine)
 * C (cytosine)
 * G (guanine)
 * T (thymine)

The two nucleotides that make up a connection are called a base pair. In DNA, the rules to base pairs are...
 * A only ever binds to T (e.g. AT or TA)
 * G only ever binds to C (e.g. GC or CG)

Terminology specific to DNA:
 * `{bm} genome` - The entire set of DNA for an organism. For eukaryotes, this refers to nuclear DNA, not the independent DNA carried by organelles such as mitochondria.
 * `{bm} gene/\b(genes|gene)\b/i` - A section of an organism's DNA that contains instructions for some functionality, typically for building some protein.
 * `{bm} allele` - A version of a gene (different coding at the some position of DNA).

# RNA

`{bm} Ribonucleic acid` (`{bm} RNA/(RNA)/`) is a nucleic acid molecule used in various ways to facilitate building proteins. It can also act as an enzyme (ribozyme) or contain the genetic information for some viruses.

RNA is commonly composed of a single strand that folds over onto itself.

RNA strands can be made up of 4 different nucleotide types (bases_nucleotide): 
* A (adenine)
* C (cytosine)
* G (guanine)
* U (uracil)

The two nucleotides that make up a connection are called a base pair. In RNA, the rules to base pairs are...
 * A only ever binds to U (e.g. AU or UA)
 * G only ever binds to C (e.g. GC or CG)

```{note}
The rules are similar to DNA, except T is replaced by U. DNA can't have U and RNA can't have T.
```

Unlike DNA, RNA is transient (lasts for minutes) and comes in multiple flavours:
 * `{bm} mRNA/(mRNA)/` or `{bm} messenger RNA` - Carries information from DNA to the ribosomes detailing a protein to build. Ribosomes are the parts of cells that synthesize proteins.
 * `{bm} tRNA/(tRNA)/` or `{bm} transfer RNA` - Brings to the ribosome the amino acids required to build the protein that the mRNA is requesting.
 * `{bm} rRNA/(rRNA)/` or `{bm} ribosomal RNA` - Makes up a large portion of the ribosome (60%). The rest of the ribosome is protein.

# Classical Genetics

`{bm} Classical genetics` is a branch of genetics focused on determining the probability of which observable traits get passed down to offspring. It was started in the 1800s by a scientist monk named `{bm} Gregor Mendel/(Gregor Mendel|Gregor Johann Mendel)/` (prior to the discovery of DNA) with his model called `{bm} Mendelian inheritance/(Mendelian inheritance|Mendelian genetics)/i`.

```{note}
Classical genetics isn't the same as the model developed by Gregor Mendel (Mendellian inheritance). Gregor Mendel wasn't aware of DNA and genes (it hadn't been discovered yet), and instead created his model based on some abstract idea of "inheritable characteristics." Classical genetics corrects and extends the model introduced by Gregor Mendel by taking DNA/chromosomes/genes/alleles/etc.. into account. 
```

```{note}
Don't be fooled by the name classical genetics. The term classical doesn't mean that it's deprecated in favour of some other branch of genetics. 
```

An organism that sexual reproduces holds 2 alleles for each gene (2 versions of each gene). 1 allele is randomly chosen from the father and the other allele is randomly chosen from the mother. Depending on which allele combinations are present, different observable traits may be expressed. For example, imagine the color of a flower is determined by a single gene. If a flower had both a red allele and a white allele for that gene, the observable trait would be that it'd have a pink color.

```{dot}
digraph G {
	subgraph clusterparent1 {
		red1 [label="Red"];
    red2 [label="Red"];
		label = "Male parent color alleles";
	}
	subgraph clusterparent2 {
		white1 [label="White"];
    white2 [label="White"];
		label = "Female parent color alleles";
	}
	subgraph clusterchild1 {
		red3 [label="Red"];
    white3 [label="White"];
		label = "Child color alleles";
	}

  red1->red3 [label="randomly chosen from male parent"];
  white2->white3 [label="randomly chosen from female parent"];
}
```

The term...
 * `{bm} genotype` refers to the alleles present for a set of one or more gene(s).
 * `{bm} phenotype` refers to the observable trait(s) expressed by a genotype.

For a gene, if an organism has...
 * the same allele twice, it's said to be `{bm} homozygous`.
 * two different alleles, it's said to be `{bm} heterozygous`.

In the above example, the genotype for flower color is 1 red allele and 1 white allele (heterozygous) while the phenotype for flower color is pink.

For each gene, offspring get a random allele from each parent. The odds of which alleles the offspring ends up with can be visualized using a `{bm} Punnett square` diagram: a table where the alleles for a gene are written across the top axis (male parent) and down the left axis (female parent), and each cell maps to the alleles in the top/left coordinate that it's in.

For example, a gene that controls the color of a flower has 2 alleles: red and white. The male parent has 2 red alleles while the female parent has both a red allele and a white allele. The Punnett square describing the odds of the offspring:

```{csv}
 , R , R
R, RR, RR
W, RW, WR
```

The above diagram visualizes that the probability of the offspring having...
 * 2 red alleles is `{kt} P(RR)=\frac{2}{4}`.
 * 2 white alleles is `{kt} P(WW)=\frac{0}{4}`.
 * a red allele and a white allele is `{kt} P(RW|WR)=\frac{2}{4}`.

Punnett squares can be extended to cover multiple genes so long as those genes are independently assorted. That is, each gene in the list must be on a different chromosome. If they were on the same chromosome, the chance of you getting gene A would be dependent on you getting gene B.

For example, a gene that controls...
* the color of a flower has 2 alleles: red and white.
* whether the flower has thorns has 2 alleles: true and false.

Both parents have 1 red allele and 1 white allele for color, and 1 true allele and 1 false allele for thorns. The Punnett square describing the odds of the offspring:

```{csv}
      , [R][T]  , [R][F]  , [W][T]  , [W][F]
[R][T], [RR][TT], [RR][RF], [RW][TT], [RW][TF]
[R][F], [RR][FT], [RR][FF], [RW][FT], [RW][FF]
[W][T], [WR][TT], [WR][TF], [WW][TT], [WW][TF]
[W][F], [WR][FT], [WR][FF], [WW][FT], [WW][FF]
```

## Segregation

The `{bm} law of segregation` (Gregor Mendel's first law) states that every organism contains 2 alleles for each gene, but when it comes time to reproduce only 1 allele is kept by the reproductive cell (gamete). As such, the resulting offspring gets 1 allele from its father and 1 allele from its mother.

```{dot}
digraph G {
	subgraph clusterparent1 {
		blue1 [label="Blue"];
    brown1 [label="Brown"];
		label = "Male parent eye color alleles";
	}
	subgraph clusterparent2 {
		brown2 [label="Brown"];
    brown3 [label="Brown"];
		label = "Female parent eye color alleles";
	}
	subgraph clusterchild1 {
		blue2 [label="Blue"];
    brown4 [label="Brown"];
		label = "Child eye color alleles";
	}

  blue1->blue2 [label="randomly chosen from male parent"];
  brown3->brown4 [label="randomly chosen from female parent"];
}
```

This law (as proposed by Gregor Mendel) matches up with the idea of chromosomes: many eyukaryotic species (e.g. humans) carry pairs of homologous chromosomes. That is, chromosomes come in pairs where each chromosome in the pair has the same set of genes as the other but different versions of those genes (alleles). One chromosome comes from the mother and the other from the father.

During meiosis, each gamete cell gets 1 chromosome from each homologous pair. When gametes meet to form an offspring, the chromosomes from each gamete match up to to their homolog to create that offspring's set of homologous chromosome pairs.

## Independent Assortment

The `{bm} law of independent assortment` (Gregor Mendel's second law) states that 

FILL ME IN

FILL ME IN

FILL ME IN

FILL ME IN

FILL ME IN

FILL ME IN

FILL ME IN

FILL ME IN

FILL ME IN

FILL ME IN

## Dominance

The `{bm} law of dominance` (Gregor Mendel's third law) states that in an organism that is heterozygous for some gene, one allele for that gene may take precedence over the other. That is, one allele will physically express itself while the other lies dormant. It turns out that this law isn't entirely correct -- it's only true for some cases. Details follow.

Depending on the gene, some alleles may take precedence in expressing themselves over others. That is, an organism may have 2 alleles present for a gene but only one of the alleles expresses themselves while the other remains dormant (e.g. you'll only see the phenotype for that expressed allele).

The phenotype for alleles that take precedence are called `{bm} dominant traits`, while the ones that don't are called `{bm} recessive traits`.

For example, the gene that controls eye color in humans has multiple alleles: one for brown, one for blue, one for green, etc... The brown allele is the dominant one, meaning that as long as 1 brown allele is present, the eye color will be brown.

```{dot}
digraph G {
	subgraph clusterparent1 {
		blue1 [label="Blue"];
    brown1 [label="Brown"];
		label = "Male parent eye color alleles";
	}
	subgraph clusterparent2 {
		brown2 [label="Brown"];
    brown3 [label="Brown"];
		label = "Female parent eye color alleles";
	}
	subgraph clusterchild1 {
		blue2 [label="Blue"];
    brown4 [label="Brown"];
		label = "Child eye color alleles";
	}

  blue1->blue2 [label="randomly chosen from male parent"];
  brown3->brown4 [label="randomly chosen from female parent"];
}
```

For the organism to have blue eyes, the child needs both copies of a gene to be a blue eye color allele (recessive). This isn't a possible outcome in the example because both parents need to have at least 1 blue eye color allele and those blue eye color alleles need to be the ones randomly chosen for the child. In the example, only 1 parent has a blue eye color allele available. See Punnett square below.

```{csv}
 , B , b
B, BB, bB
B, BB, Bb
```

The probability of blue eyes is `{kt} P(bb)=\frac{0}{4}`.

```{note}
In the diagram above, B is shorthand for brown while b is shorthand for blue. If a gene has only 2 alleles, it's sometimes a convention to use the same letter to represent both -- upper case for dominant and lower case for recessive. 
```

There are cases where a gene has more than 1 allele that can express dominance/precedence over the others (called `{bm} incomplete dominance`). For example, blood can have the alleles A, B, and O. Both A and B take precedence over O, meaning that if the 2 alleles (genotype) present in a human are...
 * A and B, their blood type (phenotype) is AB.
 * 2 As, their blood type (phenotype) is A.
 * 2 Bs, their blood type (phenotype) is B.
 * A and O, their blood type (phenotype) is A.
 * B and O, their blood type (phenotype) is B.
 * 2 Os, their blood type (phenotype) is O.

The only chance someone has of having O blood type would be for him/her to inherit an O allele from both parents.

There are also cases where all alleles of a gene can express dominance/precedence (`{bm} co-dominance/(co-dominance|co-dominant)/i`). That is, both copies of a gene will express themselves, effectively blending together. For example, in the diagram below the offspring ends up with red color allele and a white color allele. Both have equal precedence. The resulting color of the flower will be pink because both the red and white alleles will be expressed.

```{dot}
digraph G {
	subgraph clusterparent1 {
		red1 [label="Red"];
    red2 [label="Red"];
		label = "Male parent color alleles";
	}
	subgraph clusterparent2 {
		white1 [label="White"];
    white2 [label="White"];
		label = "Female parent color alleles";
	}
	subgraph clusterchild1 {
		red3 [label="Red"];
    white3 [label="White"];
		label = "Child color alleles";
	}

  red1->red3 [label="randomly chosen from male parent"];
  white2->white3 [label="randomly chosen from female parent"];
}
```

# Adenosine Triphosphate

`{bm} /\b(ATP)(?:s{0,1})\b/` `{bm} Adenosine Triphosphate` (ATP) is a molecule that provides energy to drive various biological processes (e.g. muscle contractions). The third phosphoral group at the very end has a high-energy bond. When broken, energy is released and the resulting molecules are the broken up phosphoral group and `{bm} /\b(ADP)(?:s{0,1})\b/` `{bm} Adenosine Diphosphate` (ADP).

```{note}
High-energy bonds are actually a thing: A chemical bond whose hydrolysis results in the generation of 30kJ (7kcal) of energy or, if coupled to an energetically unfavourable reaction, can drive that reaction forward. (https://www.genscript.com/molecular-biology-glossary/1364/high-energy-bond)

ATP is produced in the mitochondria. Similar to how the mitochondria is referred to as the powerhouse of the cell, ATP is often referred to as the energy currency of the cell / energy store for the cell.

# Transport

There are 2 different types of mechanism used to transport molecules in and out of a cell: passive transport and active transport.

`{bm} Passive transport` is when molecules naturally move towards the gradient. In this context, gradient refers to the natural direction in which things are supposed to go -- no explicit energy is needed to move/push it along, it just moves in that direction by virtue of some implicit property.

 * A `{bm} concentration gradient` is when the concentration of a molecule evens out in a volume just by virtue of the molecules randomly bouncing around (diffusion). For example, gas pumped into a vacuum will end up filling the vacuum evenly (more-or-less) -- traveling from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration.

   Concentration Gradient
   ```

   ```{note}
   All this is saying is that if you have a group of items clustered in a single area, each traveling at a different speed / direction, will spread out over time.
   ```

 * An `{bm} electrical gradient` is when molecules flow in some direction because their electrical charges attract. For example, a negatively charged molecule will gravitate towards a positively charged molecule. Similarly, a negative molecule will gravitate away from from other negative molecules / a positive molecule will gravitate away from other positive molecules.

   ```{img}

   Electrical Gradient
   ```

 * An `{bm} electrochemical gradient` is a combination of both a concentration gradient and an electrical gradient.

`{bm} Active transport` is when molecules use energy (e.g. ATP) to move against their gradient. It's the opposite of passive transport -- energy is explicitly used to drive a molecule to where it naturally / normally wouldn't go. An example of active transport is the "sodium potassium pump" enzyme: ATP is used to force open/close the ends of the enzyme, which allow sodium and potassium to be exchanged across the cell membrane.

Note that the active transport in the example above is the opening/closing of the enzyme ends, not the exchange of sodium and potassium. Energy (ATP) is being used to shape-shift the enzyme to open/close (active transport) while the sodium and potassium are passively entering and exiting the gates (passive transport via facilitated diffusion).

# Osmosis

`{bm} Osmosis/(osmosis|osmotic)/i` is the passive transport of solvent molecules (typically water), across a semipermeable membrane, from areas where solutes are less concentrated to areas where solutes are more concentrated.

For example, imagine you have a semipermeabl membrane that allows water molecules (solvent) to pass but not sodium (solute). That membrane is separating 2 regions, where the ...

* left region is a solution of 25% sodium (solute) and 75% water (solvent).
* right region is a solution of 75% sodium (solute) and 25% water (solvent).

There will be a net movement of some water molecules from the left region (lower solute concentration) to the right region (higher solute concentration).

```{img}

Osmosis is the diffusion of water through a semipermeable membrane down its concentration gradient. If a membrane is permeable to water, though not to a solute, water will equalize its own concentration by diffusing to the side of lower water concentration (and thus the side of higher solute concentration). In the beaker on the left, the solution on the right side of the membrane is hypertonic.
scale 0.65 0.65
```

```{note}
Another diagram that may make more sense conceptually: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Osmosis_diagram.svg
```

There are 2 reasons why osmosis happens. The first is that the semipermeable membrane will only allow certain types of molecules to pass through. If the semipermeable membrane is gated by ...

* size, the solute molecules may be too large to pass through. 
* charge, the solute molecules may not have the required charge to pass through.

The higher the concentration of solute molecules, the less likely it is for the solvent molecules to reach a pore in the semipermeable membrane. The side with the lower concentration of solute molecules is more likely to have a solvent molecule reach a pore than the other way around.

```{img}
Semipermeable membrane gated by size.svg

Semipermeable membrane with pores big enough for water but not sodium.
```

The second reason is that, depending on the charge of solvent and charge of solute, the solvent may be attracted to the solute. More solute = more chance that a solvent gets attracted to it instead of crossing a pore in the membrane. For example, if the solvent is water and the solute is sodium, the weakly negative charge of the oxygen atom in a water molecule may get attracted to the positive charge of the sodium ion.

```

`{bm} Tonicity` is the amount of pressure applied to a semipermeable membrane due to osmosis. In other words, it's the amount of water that flows in or out of a cell due to the type of solution it's put in. A ...

* `{bm} hypertonic` solution is one that has more solutes than the cell, meaning the inside of the cell loses water (cell shrivels).
* `{bm} hypotonic` solution is one that has less solutes than the cell, meaning the inside of the cell gains water (cell swells).
* `{bm} isotonic` solution is one that has a roughly equal amount of solutes, meaning the cell's water content remains the same.

# Photosynthesis

`{bm} Photosynthesis` is the process by which certain organisms convert light energy (photons) to chemical energy (sugars). These organisms are called `{bm} Photoautotroph`s, and they include ...

* plants and algae (eukaryotic), which perform photosynthesis via their chloroplast.
* cyanobacterium, which are bacteria that can generate their own food.

```{note}
Another way to think of photosynthesis is that it uses light energy (PHOTOsynthesis) to synthesize (photoSYNTHESIS) sugars.
```

```{note}
Chloroplast and cyanobacterium share a similar structure. It's speculated that they have the same parent organism: that parent formed an endosymbiotic relationship with a larger cell and eventually became the chloroplast organelle.
```

The overall chemical reaction for this is `{kt} 6CO_2 + 6H_2O + energy \to C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2`. Carbon dioxide gas (`{kt} CO_2`) bonds with water (`{kt} H_2O`) using energy from the sun (photons), creating glucose (`{kt} C_6H_{12}O_6`).

This reaction happens in 2 steps:

1. `{bm}Light-dependent reaction`s: Energy molecules are created from water and photos, with oxygen being a byproduct.

   This occurs in a thylakoid membrane.

   ```{img}

2. `{bm} Calvin cycle`: It's a cyclical process that requires multiple iterations (3?) to produce a single glucose molecule. Each cycle, ATP and NADPH are used for energy (producing ADP and NADP+ respectively), while the carbon dioxide (`{kt} CO_2`) is used as a source of carbons for the resulting glucose.

   This occurs in the stroma.

# Cellular Respiration

`{bm} Cellular respiration` is the process by which certain organisms convert glucose (sugar) to energy. These organisms include ...

* eukaryotic cells, which perform cellular respiration via their mitochondria.
* bacteria which share their ancestry with mitochondria.

``` {note}
Remember that all eukaryotes have mitochondria -- both plant and animal cells. Unsure if all bacteria can perform cellular respiration?
```

The overall chemical reaction for this is `{kt} C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2 \to 6CO_2 + 6H_2O + energy`. Glucose (`{kt} C_6H_{12}O_6`) and oxygen (`{kt} O_2`) break down into carbon dioxide gas (`{kt} CO_2`), water (`{kt} H_2O`), and energy (roughly 38 ATP molecules and some heat).

```{note}
The number of ATPs actually generated is variable and dependent on many factors, but 38 is the generally agreed upon number.
```

The reaction happens in 3 steps:

1. `{bm} Glycolysis`: The carbon backbone of the glucose molecule is split, creating 2 `{bm} Pyruvate` molecules along with water and several other molecules. This is an anaerobic process (no oxygen needed) that nets 2 ATPs. This happens in the cytoplasm of cells.

Because the Krebs cycle and the oxidative phosphorylation are aerobic processes (require oxygen), if no oxygen is present the output of glycolysis goes through a process called `{bm} fermentation/(ferment|fermentation)/i`. Fermentation is an anaerobic process (no oxygen required). Depending on the organism, it'll end up producing either...

* `{bm} alcohol` via `{bm} alcohol fermentation` (e.g. yeast).
* `{bm} lactic acid` via `{bm} lactic acid fermentation` (e.g. humans and mammals).

Fermentation does produce ATP, but much less so than Kerbs cycle + oxidative phosphorylation. 

For example, if a human is vigorously running, that human may not have enough oxygen available to trigger the Krebs cycle / oxidative phosphorylation (steps 2 and 3). As such, the output from glycolysis (step 1) will end up going through lactic acid fermentation instead.

The following workflow diagram provides a ultra-simple high-level overview of the processes that take place. Note that this doesn't specify how many of each molecule get input / output, nor does it provide a complete set of a input / output molecules for each reaction.

# Sodium Potassium Pump

The `{bm} sodium potassium pump` is an transmembrane enzyme that allows the exchange of sodium ions and potassium ions across the cell membrane by opening and closing its ends.

Example of primary active transport, where energy from hydrolysis of ATP is directly coupled to the movement of a specific substance across a membrane independent of any other species.
```

Only 1 end of the enzyme is open at a time. When the...

* intracellular end is open, the enzyme has an affinity for 3 sodium ions followed by an affinity for ATP.
* extracellular end is open, the enzyme has an affinity for 2 potassium ions.

Since both potassium and sodium have a positive charge and an an unequal number are being exchanged each cycle (3 sodium out vs 2 potassium in), the intracellular space will be more positive than the extracellular space.

This charge difference is further reinforced by membrane channel proteins which allow potassium ions to flow across the membrane (potassium channels). Since there's a higher concentration of potassium ions inside the cell, those potassium ions have a higher chance of flowing through the channel to the outside. Some percentage may be impeded by the slightly more positive charge on the outside, but overall more will make it to the outside than stay on the inside.

This charge difference is referred to as the `{bm} resting membrane potential` for a cell.

# Microscopy

`{bm} Microscope`s are devices used to magnify (zoom in) on objects, such that you can see things that you normally would be too small to see on your own. The term microscope comes from the words...
* micro, meaning small.
* scope, meaning to look at.

A picture taken through a microscope is called a `{bm} micrograph`. The distinguishing factors for most microscopes or the amount of magnification and the resolution of the output image.

There are different types of microscopes:
* `{bm} Simple microscope`s have just one lense (e.g. magnifying glass).
* `{bm} Compound microscope`s have 2 ore more lenses (e.g. traditional microscopes used in labs).
  * `{bm} Light microscope`s / `{bm} Brightfield microscope`s work by shining a light through the specimen (which can be alive) and into the lens system that eventually reaches your eye. They're the type of microscopes typically used in student labs.
    * `{bm} Fluorescence microscope`s are microscopes that require the specimen being viewed is treated in some way to make it glow, allowing you to highlight parts of the specimen.
    * `{bm} Confocal microscope`s are a special form of fluorescence microscopes that uses a laser to excite a sample and get it to glow fluorescent.
* `{bm} Electron microscope`s use beams of electrons rather than beams of light. They produce very magnified very high resolutions images. But, unlike light microscopes, the specimens being observed are dead because electron microscopes operate in a vacuum.
  * `{bm} scanning electron microscope`s (SEM) work by scanning a beam of electrons over the surface of the specimen to produce an image of the 3D surface.
  * `{bm} transmission electron microscope`s (TEM) work by slicing up the specimen into ultra thin slices and and passing an electron bean through those slices to produce an image of the insides.

# Other Terminology

Terminology that's relevant but doesn't fit in any other section goes here.

`{bm-ignore} condense`
`{bm} Density/(density|dense)/i` - The mass per unit volume of a substance.

`{bm} Specific heat capacity/(heat capacity|heat capacities)/i` - The amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of one gram of a substance by one degree Celsius.

`{bm} Heat of vaporization` - The amount of energy needed to change one gram of a liquid substance to a gas at constant temperature.

`{bm} Endosymbiosis/(endosymbiosis|endosymbiotic)/i` - A form of symbiosis where one organism lives inside of of the other (e.g. gut bacteria lives in our colon). The prefix *endo* means *within*.

`{bm} Diffusion/(diffusion|diffuse)/i` - A physical process where molecules of a material move from an area of high concentration (where there are many molecules) to an area of low concentration (where there are fewer molecules) until it has reached equilibrium (molecules evenly spread). [See more](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion).

`{bm} Equilibrium` - A state in which opposing forces / influences are balanced. In the context of a concentration gradient, it means the state at which a substance is equally distributed throughout the volume that it's in (roughly).

`{bm} Permeability/(permeable|permeability)/i` - The state or quality of a material or membrane that causes it to allow liquids/gases to pass through it.

`{bm} Semipermeable/(semipermeable|selectively permeable)/i` - The state or quality of a material or membrane that causes it to allow certain types of molecules to pass through it.

`{bm} Intracellular` - The fluid inside of the cell, which is technically on the inside of the cell membrane (cytoplasm).

`{bm} Extracellular` - The fluid outside of the cell.

```{note}
Technically unsure at which layer the extracellular region begins. Is it outside of the cell membrane? cell wall? cell capsule? I'm pretty sure any fluid outside of the cell membrane qualifies as extracellular, while any fluid inside of the cell membrane qualifies as intracellular (cytoplasm).
```

`{bm} Aerobic` - A biological process that requires oxygen.

`{bm} Anaerobic` - A biological process that doesn't require oxygen.

`{bm} Fission` - The act of dividing or splitting something into two or more parts.

`{bm} Tetrad` - A group / set of 4.

`{bm} Homologous/(Homologous|Homology|Homolog)/i` - Having the same relation, relative position, or structure. Particularly in biology, it s the existence of a shared ancestry between a pair of structures or genes.

`{bm} Karyotype` - Micrograph image of diploid set of chromosomes, grouped in pairs.

`{bm} Asexual` - When offspring is created using the genetic material from 1 parent. The offspring are essentially copies of the parent in terms of their genetic material (clone). Examples of asexual reproduction include:
  * `{bm} Binary fission` - Process of cloning a prokaryotic cell and certain organelle inside of eukaryotic cell (e.g. mitochondria).
  * Mitosis - Process of cloning a eukaryotic cell.
  * `{bm} Budding` - When a growth on a plant or animal breaks off, that broken piece is the offspring.
  * `{bm} Fragmentation` - When an organism breaks into two or more pieces, each fragment grows back into a whole.
  * `{bm} Parthenogenesis` - When an animal lays an egg_GAMETE but that egg_GAMETE already has all the genetic information needed to develop (it doesn't need to be fertilized).

`{bm} Sexual` - When offspring is created by fusing genetic material from 2 parents. The offspring has a mixture of genetic material from both parents. An example of sexual reproduction is when a gamete cells merge to create the offspring.

```{note}
In some cases, the genetic material being fused in sexual reproduction may be from the same parent. Answer to a question on the site... it is still sexual, because sexual reproduction means fusion of male and female gametes, doesn't matter if they're from the same plant. polliation is the transfer of pollengrains from anther to stigma, further to reach ovary. in case of a bisexual flower, it is called self-pollination.when two different flowers pollinate it is cross pollination.
```

`{bm} Model system` - A system with a reduced set of parameters/complexity that makes it easy for a researcher to investigate a particular scientific question. For example, Gregor Mendel used pea pods to research the theory of classical genetics / inheritance (simple, grows and matures quickly, inbreeding okay)
