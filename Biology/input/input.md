# Introduction

Biology is defined as the study of life / living things. A living thing is defined as anything that converts energy from one form to another, while using that energy to grow, change, and reproduce.

# Scientific Method

The `{bm} scientific method` is the standard guideline for discovery and experimentation in the sciences (chemistry, physics, biology, etc..) The basic steps are...

1. Observe.
2. Ask a question about the observation.
3. Make a guess that answers the question (hypothesis).
4. Test the guess to see if it's correct (experiment).
5. Refine and iterate.

The last step (refine and iterate) just means that you do it all over again but make changes based on the things you learned from your experiment. For example, ...

* do additional experiments to dig into some aspect deeper.
* if the hypothesis wasn't supported by the experiment, maybe come up with a new hypothesis.

## Hypothesis

The scientific method revolves around making an observation and coming up with a testable explanation for that observation -- called a `{bm} hypothesis`. If the explanation isn't *testable*, you can't consider it a hypothesis. For example, a good hypothesis may be that increased sun exposure leads to an increased risk of skin cancer because it's something you can test. A bad explanation may be that exposure to centaurs increase the risk of skin cancer because centaurs don't exist (and as such the hypothesis can't be tested).

```{note}
The material mentions that for a hypothesis to be testable, you should be able to come up with an experiment that shows that its false -- it's falsifiable. How you word your hypothesis is typically what determines if it's testable/falsifiable -- when you read the hypothesis, what defines a failure?
```

```{note}
A hypothesis and a theory are different things. Hypothesis is a potential answer for a specific problem. A theory provides a potential framework for a much broader class of problems based on supporting evidence. The example given by the material: "The toaster won't toast because the electrical outlet is broken" is a hypothesis, whereas "Electrical appliances need a source of electricity in order to run" is closer to a theory.
```
## Experiment

Once you have a hypothesis, you design an `{bm} experiment` to test it. In the case of our sun exposure leads to increased risk of skin cancer hypothesis, an experiment may be to expose skin cells to UV rays in amounts equivalent to that given off by the sun and then check to see if those cells have been damaged (compared to a control group of skin cells that you haven't exposed to UV rays).

What makes a good experiment?

* `{bm} Control group` - A control group contains a set of entities that don't get treatment, but those entities are equal to the entities in the `{bm} experimental group` (as much as possible) and exposed to the same conditions as the entities in the experimental group (as much as possible). This helps eliminate outside factors/variables from tainting the results of an experiment -- it's a `{bm} controlled experiment` . For example, in the skin cancer example experiment described above, a control group may be a set of skin cells that sit along side the experimental group skin cells that get treated with UV rays -- the cells in the control group shouldn't show signs of damage while the cells in the experimental group should.
* `{bm} Random selection` - The entities being used for an experiment must be randomly selected (both for the control group and the experimental group). Random selection helps minimize skewed results introduced from bias during the selection process. For example, the individual responsible for selecting candidates for drug trials may choose to disproportionately select people of a certain race (e.g. racism).
* `{bm} Double blind` - The people conducting the experiment may implicitly/explicitly taint the experiment via their own bias. For example, if the experiment involves an interviewer asking a set of questions, the interviewer may subconsciously change the pronunciations of words if he/she knows that the interviewee is in the control group, there by effecting the answer given by the interviewee.
* **Statistical significance** - The results between the control group and the experimental group needs to be large enough to support your hypothesis. A small difference could mean that outcome was due to variance in the selected groups (there's a branch of statistics that deals with this).
* **Replicable** - Others should be able to repeat the same experiment and (hopefully) come to the same result. If they don't, it could be that something was wrong with your experiment or the entities being tested had some underlying difference that changed the result.

```{note}
There's always at least one control group in any experiment to provide a baseline. There's no limit to the number of experimental groups -- each group may have a slightly different type/amount of treatment applied.
```

```{note}
Because things are so wishy-washy/not-exacty in biology, it's typical for an experiments to be repeated multiple times and to have a large sample size -- the larger our sample sizes and the more times we conduct the experiment, the more we can be confident of our result. What do I mean by wishy-washy? Genetic variation between samples may result in different types/levels of responses. For example, people with a certain gene may respond quicker to certain drugs than people who don't produce that gene.
```

Other terminology around the scientific method...

* `{bm} treatment` - The application of the test given to the experimental group(s) but not the control group.
* `{bm} independent variable` - An independent variable is basically the treatment you apply -- you can think of it as the input knob you control for your experiment. For example, in the skin cancer experiment, the independent variable would be the amount of artificial UV rays you apply to the skin cells.
* `{bm} dependent variable` - A dependent variable is a response you measure after applying the treatment -- you can think of it as the output from your experiment. For example, in the skin cancer experiment, the dependent variable might be a measurement of how different the cells are functioning (e.g. a cell with damaged DNA may produce different kinds / amounts of tRNA molecules -- something you can measure).
* **data** - This is exactly what you think it is -- measurements/observations made during the experiment.
* `{bm}|no_out placebo` `{bm} placebo effect` - When experimenting on people, there's a phenomenon called the placebo effect: if someone takes something that shouldn't help them but are under the impression it will help them, it often times will help them, just from the psychological effect alone.

```{note}
You can have more than one independent variable if you follow specific guidelines and are experienced enough, but the general rule of thumb is to have only 1 independent variable just because it makes things much simpler to analyze/interpret.
```

# Chemistry

An **element** is matter that cannot be broken down any further by chemical reaction -- it's a substance made entirely out of one type of `{bm} atom`. Each element/atom has a specific set of properties that defines how it acts/reacts (e.g. weight, colour, how light reflects, etc..).

Examples of elements/atoms:
* Gold - Yellow coloured, reflective, malleable, and corrosion-resistant.
* Lead - Blue/white coloured, relatively soft, malleable.
* Carbon Silver/gray coloured, reflective, easily oxidizes/corrodes.

Examples of non-elements:
* Salt water - Mixture of sodium and water.
* Water - Water can be further broken down to the elements hydrogen and oxygen.
* Glucose - Glucose can be further broken down to the elements carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.

The building blocks of atoms are `{bm} protons`, `{bm} neutrons`, and `{bm} electrons`. Protons and neutrons form the nucleus of the atom while electrons jump around outside of the nucleus. Protons and electrons are attracted to each other -- protons are positively charged while electrons are negatively charged. Although, protons and electrons never fully meet (electrons are always buzzing/hovering around the outside of the nucleus where the protons are).

The configuration of an atom (protons/neutrons/electrons) is what allows us to predicate how one element may react to another element. For example, certain elements may attract, repel, bond, swipe electrons, etc..

The number of protons are what defines the type of atom/element. For example, hydrogen has 1 proton, helium as 2, lithium has 3, etc.. The number of neutrons and electrons can change without changing the type of element as long as the number of protons remain the same.

The periodic table below orders elements/atoms by the number of protons (also called the `{bm} atomic number`)...

```{note}
A different number of neutrons = different version of the same element. For example, Carbon-12 (6 neutrons) and Carbon-13 (7 neutrons).
```

When atoms bind together, they form a `{bm} molecule`. Each type of molecule has the same configuration of atoms -- same atoms in the same numbers, structured/shaped similarly. For example, a water molecule is made up of 2 hydrogen atoms and 1 oxygen atom binding together in a house-roof shape...

```{note}
As far as I can tell, the atoms will always bind in the same way. You can't ever have a molecule that has the same types of atoms in the same numbers but with a different structure.
```

A `{bm} monomer` is a special designation for atoms/molecules that are able to join with other monomers to create even larger molecules. The process of joining is called `{bm} polymerization` `{bm}|no_out polymerize` and the resulting molecule is called a `{bm} polymer`.

```{dot}
digraph {
  rankdir=LR;
  "monomer"->"polymer" [taillabel="1..*", headlabel="1", arrowhead=none];
}
```

If the monomers that make up a polymer are all the same, the polymer is called a `{bm} homopolymer`. Otherwise, it's called a `{bm} heteropolymer` / `{bm} copolymer`.

For example, the glucose molecule is a monomer. It can combine with other glucose molecules to create the glycogen molecule, which is a polymer / homopolymer. Other examples of polymers (according to Wikipedia): amino acids and nucleotides (DNA).

```{note}
There are probably special properties to monomers that allow them to chain up. The Wikipedia page talks about a feature of monomers being a "carbon double bond" which is what allows them to form polymers.
```

Polymers are often referred to as `{bm} macromolecule`s -- molecules that have a very large number of atoms.

## Carbohydrate Molecules

`{bm} Carbohydrate`s (also called `{bm} saccharide`s) are molecules that consist of a mix of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms. In biological systems, carbohydrates are often associated with...
* being a source of energy
* providing a structural role (for plants / certain plants).

```{note}
It was never explained what 'structural role' actually means.
```

The term `{bm} monosaccharide` is just means a carbohydrate that's a monomer (e.g. glucose). Similarly, the term `{bm} polysaccharide` means a carbohydrate built from other monosaccharides (e.g. glycogen is made of chained glucose).

```{dot}
digraph {
  rankdir=LR;
  "monosaccharide"->"polysaccharide" [taillabel="1..*", headlabel="1", arrowhead=none];
}
```

## Protein Molecules

`{bm} Protein`s are molecules that consist of monomers called `{bm} amino acid`s. The amino acids get chained together into a polymer called a `{bm} polypeptide` chain, and one or more polypeptide chains fold to a 3D structure and combine to become a protein. The 3D structure / shape of the protein (how its folded) is what gives it its abilities.

In biological systems, proteins are often associated with that facilitating some biological function. For example, the protein protease is responsible for breaking down food.

```{dot}
digraph {
  rankdir=LR;
  "amino acid"->"polypeptide" [taillabel="1..*", headlabel="1", arrowhead=none];
  "polypeptide"->"protein" [taillabel="1..*", headlabel="1", arrowhead=none];
}
```

The ribosome is what's responsible for folding? Not able to get a clear answer on this.

## Lipid Molecules

`{bm} Lipids` are molecules that are somewhat not water soluble -- meaning that they have parts that resist water but maybe also parts that are attracted to water. In biological systems, lipids are often associated with...
* energy storage (fats)
* cellular membranes (phospholipids)

```{note}
Lipids are not always fats. All fats are lipids but not all lipids are fats.
```

## Nucleic Acid Molecules

`{bm} Nucleic Acid` is a molecule (heteropolymer) often associated with information storage. It's built up from other molecules called `{bm} nucleotides` (monomers).

`{bm} Deoxyribonucleic acid` (`{bm} DNA`) is the most common form of nucleic acid.

```{note}
It's called nucleic acid because it's in the nucleus of a cell and it has some acidic properties to it.
```

## Water Molecule

`{bm} Water` is essential to life -- it has unique properties that almost all biological processes depend on.

Recall that...
1. a water molecule consists of 2 hydrogen atoms connected to an oxygen atom via covalent bonds. A `{bm} covalent bond` is a pair of electrons that both atoms share, thus bonding the atoms together.
1. the position of an electron is based on probability. Electrons aren't fixed in a certain position or neatly orbiting around a nucleus as certain diagrams show. Rather, they're constantly buzzing/hopping around the nucleus. Depending on their environment, they may be more likely to be at certain locations vs other locations.

Oxygen atoms are extremely `{bm} electronegative`, meaning that oxygen has the propensity to pull the buzzing/hopping electrons more around itself than the atoms it's bound to. As such, in a water molecule, the electrons will spend more time solely around the oxygen atom than they do the hydrogen atom or a position that binds the hydrogen and oxygen together. This is what gives the oxygen atom in a water molecule a `{bm} weakly negative` charge (as indicated by δ-) while the hydrogen atoms have a `{bm} weakly positive` charge (as indicated by δ+). These types of charged molecules are called `{bm} polar molecule`s.

```{note}
Notice the shape of the water molecule in the diagram(s) above. Electron pairs are repelled from each other. They're also responsible for binding. That's what gives molecules their shapes/structure.
```

This weakly negative / weakly positive charge is what gives water several of the unique properties that biological properties depend on. Water molecules have a tendency to gravitate towards each other because the weakly negative oxygen atoms and the weakly positive hydrogen atoms of different water molecules attract. This attraction is called a `{bm} hydrogen bond`. Hydrogen bonds are weaker than covalent bonds in that the bonds aren't really solid -- water molecules can easily break off and go past each other.

```{note}
The above paragraph is just giving the mechanics for how/why water is a liquid. Water is the only molecule that's liquid at room temperature? This can't be right -- see https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/q/76346. Why can't biological processes work in one of these other molecules just as they do in water? Maybe because they stay liquid at a shorter temperature range (e.g. 15-25C instead of 1-99C?
```

The weak attraction between water molecules is also what makes water a `{bm} solvent`. So long as they're polar molecules, other molecules can travel inside of water using the same attraction from weakly negative / weakly positive charges -- they gravitate and float around water molecules just as other water molecules do. For example, the cytoplasm of a cell is a solvent (mostly water). It works because other molecules in the cytoplasm (e.g. cellular machinery) can float around / travel around using the weakly negative / weakly positive charges.

Water is called a `{bm} universal solvent` because it can dissolve more molecules than other other liquid. Note that the term universal doesn't mean that it can dissolve everything, just that it can dissolve more things than the others.

The properties that make water conducive for biological processes to operate:

* Fluid under normal conditions - under normal temperatures, pressures, etc.. there's *cohesion* between other water molecules (fluid) / *adhesion* between water molecules and other polar molecules / ions (solvent).
* Universal solvent - Water dissolves more things than any other liquid (more things doesn't mean everything).
* High heat capacity - Because it takes a lot of energy to heat up water, its temperature can remain relatively stable as the environment around it changes (temperature regulation).
* High heat of vaporization - As water evaporates, it traps heat from whatever its on (e.g. human body) and releases it into the environment (temperature regulation / cooling).
* Less dense as a solid - As water freezes it forms crystals that space the molecules away from each other. As such, it becomes less dense than liquid water and ends up floats on top. This means bodies of water can freeze over but life can continue operating in the liquid underneath the frozen ice.

Other terminology related to water:
* Molecules that are charged are called polar molecules (e.g. the water molecule is a polar molecule because of its weakly positive / weakly negative charge).
* Molecules / ions that are charged and mixed with a solvent are called `{bm} solute`s.
* Molecules that are attracted to water are called `{bm} hydrophilic`.
* Molecules that are repelled from water are called `{bm} hydrophobic`.
