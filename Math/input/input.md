# Order of Operations

The `{bm} order of operations` are as follows:

1. Brackets
1. Exponents
1. Division and Multiplication (evaluated left-to-right)
1. Addition and Subtraction (evaluated left-to-right)

These rules are often abbreviated as either...

* `{bm} BEDMAS` - Brackets / Exponents / Division and Multiplication / Addition and Subtraction
* `{bm} PEMDAS` - Parenthesis / Exponents / Multiplication and Division / Addition and Subtraction

Note that these 2 are essentially the same. Division and multiplication are swapped, but since division and multiplication are evaluated left-to-right in the same step, it makes no difference.

# Algebra Rules

KEEP WORKING ON THESE:
ADD FRACTION ADDING AND MULTIPLICATION RULES (recipriocals, cross multiply, etc..)
ADD REMAINING ALGEBRA RULES

ADD TRIVIAL AND NON-TRIVIAL EXAMPLES


Commutative Property

* `{kt} a \cdot b = b \cdot a`
* `{kt} a + b = b + a`

Associative Property

* `{kt} (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)`
* `{kt} (a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)`

Distributive Property

* `{kt} a(b+c) = a \cdot b + a \cdot c`
* `{kt} a(b \cdot c) = a \cdot b \cdot a \cdot c`

Identity Property

* `{kt} a \cdot 1 = 1 \cdot a = a`
* `{kt} a + 0 = 0 + a = a`

Additive Inverse Property

* `{kt} a + (-a) = -a + a = 0`

Multiplicative Inverse / Multiplicative Reciprocal Property

* `{kt} a \cdot \frac{1}{a} = \frac{1}{a} \cdot a = 1`
